NOW
================

Gets the current system time as a Date Serial

Syntax:
declare function Now ( ) as double

Usage:
#include "vbcompat.bi"
result = Now

Return Value:
Returns a date serial containing the system's date and time at execution time.

Description:
As the time is the decimal part of a date serial, if the value of Now is saved
to an integer, the time in it will be reset to 00:00:00

The compiler will not recognize this function unless `vbcompat.bi` is
included.
