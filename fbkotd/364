Compiler Option: -m
================

Main file without extension to indicate the main module

Syntax:
-m < source file >

Parameters:

`source file`
The name without extension of the main module source file

Description:

The `-m` compiler option specifies a main entry point for a source file; the
argument is the name of a source file minus its extension.
So the main module file must be called twice in the command line:

- after compile option "-m", but without specified extension,
- and also like any module to compile, but there with its specified extension.

WARNING: the spelling of < source file > is case-sensitive! (unexpected ERRORS
may otherwise occure)

If "-m" is not specified, the first source file listed is given a main entry
point.

When using the "-c" or "-r" switch, "-m" must be specified when compiling a
main source file.

The intrinsic macro `__FB_MAIN__` is defined in the main module and not
defined in other modules.
