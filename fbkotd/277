OPTION EXPLICIT
================

Forces variables, objects and arrays to be declared before they are used

Syntax:
Option Explicit

Description:
`Option Explicit` is a statement that forces any following variable, object or
array usage to be preceded by a declaration, with, for example, `Dim` or
`Static`. This rule remains in effect for the rest of the module in which
`Option Explicit` is used, and cannot be overridden.

Examples:

'' Compile with the "-lang qb" or "-lang fblite" compiler switches
#lang "fblite"
Option Explicit
Dim a As Integer            ' 'a' must be declared..
a = 1                       ' ..or this statement will fail to compile.

Dialect Differences:
Only available in the -lang fblite and -lang qb dialects.

Differences from QB:
New to FreeBASIC
