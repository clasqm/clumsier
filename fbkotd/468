PRESET
================

Plots a single pixel

Syntax:
PReset [target ,] [STEP] (x, y) [,color]

Parameters:

`target`
specifies buffer to draw on.

`STEP`
indicates that coordinates are relative

`(x, y)`
coordinates of the pixel.

`color`
the color attribute.

Description:

`target` specifies buffer to draw on. `target` may be an image created with
`ImageCreate` or `Get (Graphics)`. If omitted, target defaults to the screen's
current work page.

`(x, y)` are the coordinates of the pixel. STEP if present, indicates that
`(x, y)` coordinates are relative to the graphics cursor position. If omitted,
`(x, y)` are relative to the upper left-hand corner of `target`. The x and y
coordinates are affected by the last call to the `View (Graphics)` and
`Window` statements, and respect the current clipping region as set by the
`View (Graphics)` statement.

`color` specifies the color attribute. If omitted, `color` defaults to the
current background color. See `Color`. `color` is graphics mode specific, see
`Color` and `Screen (Graphics)` for details.

Examples:

Screen 13

'Set background color to 15
Color , 15

'Draw a pixel with the background color at 10, 10
PReset (10,10)

'Draw a pixel with the background color at Last x cord +10, Last y cord +10
PReset Step (10,10)
Sleep


Differences from QB:
  * `target` is new to FreeBASIC
