Installing gcc for -gen gcc
================

Windows 32bit

If you are using the `FreeBASIC-x.xx.x-win32` package, you can use our pre-
made gcc package. Download `gcc-x.x.x-for-FB-win32-gengcc.zip` from the
Binaries - Windows/More/ directory at the fbc downloads area, and extract it
into the FreeBASIC installation directory (where fbc.exe is), such that
`gcc.exe` and `cc1.exe` will be placed in these locations:

  * `bin\win32\gcc.exe`
  * `bin\libexec\gcc\i686-w64-mingw32\x.x.x\cc1.exe`

You can also download Win32 versions of gcc directly from the MinGW.org or
MinGW-w64 projects.

Windows 64bit

The `FreeBASIC-x.xx.x-win64` package already comes with gcc included, and uses
`-gen gcc` by default (because `-gen gas` does not support 64bit).

DOS

It requires a (minimal) DJGPP installation. DJGPP can be downloaded from the
DJGPP website. At least the `djdev*.zip` and `gcc*b.zip` are needed. In order
to run the DJGPP gcc, the `DJGPP` environment variable must be set to point to
the `djgpp.env` file.

To use the DJGPP gcc with the `FreeBASIC-x.xx.x-dos` package, copy gcc.exe and
cc1.exe into the FreeBASIC installation directory, such that they will be
placed in these locations:

  * `bin\dos\gcc.exe`
  * `bin\libexec\gcc\djgpp\x.xx\cc1.exe`

Linux

Typically the `gcc` package is already installed, or it can be installed by
doing something like:

`sudo apt-get install gcc`

(the exact command depends on your GNU/Linux distribution)

Non-standalone fbc installed into DJGPP/MinGW toolchains

If you are using a non-standalone version of fbc (e.g. from one of the
`fbc-x.xx.x-win32` packages), and have it installed inside a DJGPP or MinGW
toolchain, then `-gen gcc` should already work, as the DJGPP or MinGW
toolchains provide gcc.

As long as gcc.exe is in the same directory as fbc.exe (typically
`C:\DJGPP\bin\` or `C:\MinGW\bin\`), or available in the `PATH` environment
variable, fbc.exe should be able to find and use it.
