OPEN SCRN
================

Opens the console directly for input and output as a file

Syntax:
Open Scrn [for mode] as [#]filenumber as long

Usage:
Open Scrn [for mode] as [#]filenumber

or

result = Open Scrn( [for mode[,]] as [#]filenumber )

Parameters:

`mode`
Either `Input` or `Output`. If omitted, `Output` is assumed.

`filenumber`
An unused file number.

Return Value:
A 32 bit `Long`: a zero (`0`) is returned if `Open Scrn()` completed
successfully, otherwise a non-zero value is returned to indicate failure.

Description:

This command opens the console for both input and output as a file, allowing
to read/write from/to it with normal file commands.

This command may use direct access to the console for speed in some
implementations, so it should not be used when the input / output is required
to be redirected or piped with OS commands.

The normal console commands, such as `Color` and `Locate`, do not work in this
mode, because they do not accept a file number.

The `[For Input|Output]` clause is allowed for compatibility, but is ignored.

`filenumber` is an unused file number.

An unused file number can be found using `FreeFile`.

The error code returned by `Open Scrn` can be checked using `Err` in the next
line. The function version of `Open Scrn` returns directly the error code as a
32 bit `Long`.

Runtime errors:

`Open Scrn` throws one of the following runtime errors:

(`1`) Illegal function call

  * `filenumber` was not free at the time. use `Freefile` to ensure that `filenumber` is free.

Examples:

Dim a As String
Open Scrn For Input  As #1
Print #1,"Please write something and press ENTER"
Line Input #1,a
Print #1, "You wrote";a
Close
Sleep


Differences from QB:
