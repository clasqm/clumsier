Iterating Operators
===============

Operators that work with iterator objects

These operators allow objects of user-defined types to be used as iterators
and step values in `For...Next` statements.

Operator For
	Allows an iterator a chance to prepare for the loop.

Operator Step
	Increments an iterator object.

Operator Next
	Determines if the loop should terminate or continue iterating.
