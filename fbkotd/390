MKS
================

Does a binary copy from a `single` variable to a `string`, setting its length
to 4 bytes

Syntax:
declare function Mks ( byval number as single ) as string

Usage:
result = Mks[$]( number )

Parameters:

`number`
A `single` variable to binary copy to a `string`.

Return Value:
Returns a `string` with a binary copy of the `single`.

Description:

Does a binary copy from a `Single` variable to a `string`, setting its length
to 4 bytes. The resulting string can be read back to a `single` by `Cvs`.

This function is useful to write numeric values to buffers without using a
`Type` definition.

Examples:

Dim n As Single, e As String
n = 1.2345
e = MKS(n)
Print n, CVS(e)

  * The string type suffix "$" is optional in the -lang fblite dialect.
  * The string type suffix "$" is ignored in the -lang fb dialect, warn
  only with the -w suffix compile option (or -w pedantic compile option).
