objinfo
================

fbc stores extra information into the object files (.o) it generates, in order
to read it out again at link-time. The information that is stored currently
consists of the -lang/-mt settings and all libraries/search paths (-l,
#inclib, -p, #libpath) that were specified when compiling that object file.
This way fbc can show a warning when mixing object files that were compiled
with different options, because they may be incompatible, and fbc can
automatically link in libraries that were specified via #inclib, even if the
user compiles and links in separate steps.

This is accomplished by emitting an extra section called "fbctinf" (FreeBASIC
compile time information?) when compiling, and reading it back in at link-
time. Furthermore, when building a static library, fbc creates an extra object
file (called __fb_ct.inf) containing just that extra information and adds it
to the library. At link-time fbc looks at each library to figure out whether
it has such an __fb_ct.inf file or not.

In order to do this fbc has a custom COFF, ELF32 and also archive file format
readers that can extract the .fbctinf section content. Previously, fbc used
libbfd from binutils to do this, however depending on libbfd is problematic
especially because of its highly unstable ABI.
