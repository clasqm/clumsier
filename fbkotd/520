WRITE #
================

Outputs a comma-separated list of values to a text file or device

Syntax:
Write # filenum , [ expressionlist ]

Parameters:

`filenum`
File number of an open file or device opened for `Output` or `Append`.

`expressionlist`
Comma-separated list of items to print

Description:

Outputs the values in `expressionlist` to the text file or device bound to
`filenum`. The values are separated with commas, and strings are enclosed in
double quotes. Numeric values greater than zero (`0`) and less than one (`1`)
are prefixed with a zero (`0`) if none is given (e.g., a value of `-.123` will
be output as `-0.123`). Extra zeroes are truncated.

If no expression list is given, `Write #` outputs a carriage return (note that
the comma after `filenum` is still necessary, even if no expression list is
given).
The purpose of `Write #` is to create a file that can be read back by using
Input #.

Examples:

Const filename As String = "file.txt"

Dim filenum As Integer = FreeFile()
If 0 <> Open(filename, For Output, As filenum) Then
    Print "error opening " & filename & " for output."
    End -1
End If

Dim i As Integer = 10
Dim d As Double = 123.456
Dim s As String = "text"

Write #filenum, 123, "text", -.45600
Write #filenum,
Write #filenum, i, d, s

will produce the file:


 
 
    123,"text",-0.456
 
    10,123.456,"text"
