COLOR
================

Sets the display foreground / background color that is used with console
output and graphics output of text

Syntax:
declare function Color ( byval foreground as ulong , byval background as ulong
) as ulong

Usage:
Color [foreground] [, background]
result = Color [( [foreground] [, background] )]

Parameters:

`foreground`

the foreground color to set

`background`

the background color to set

Return Value:
Returns a 32-bit value containing the current foreground color in the `low
word` and the current background color in the `high word`.
In hi/truecolor modes, only the foreground color is returned, taking up the
whole 32 bits. Instead, see `ScreenControl` to return the current graphics
mode color (foreground and background).

The old color values can be retrieved at the same time as setting new ones.

Description:

The `Color` statement sets the current foreground and/or background colors.
`Circle`, `Draw`, `Line (Graphics)`, `Cls`, `Paint`, `Print`, `PReset` and
`PSet` all use the last colors set by this function when you don't specify a
color to them, where applicable. The color values that `Color` accepts depend
on the current graphics mode.

Mode Meaning
1 foreground is screen color (ranging 0-15). background is the emulated CGA
palette to be used: 0 (green, red, and brown), 1 (cyan, magenta and white), 2
(same as 0, but with bright colors) or 3 (same as 1, but with bright colors)
2, 11 foreground is a color index in current palette (ranging 0-1). background
is a color index in current palette (ranging 0-1).
7, 8 foreground is a color index in current palette (ranging 0-15). background
is screen color index in current palette (ranging 0-15).
9 foreground is a color index in current palette (ranging 0-63). background is
screen color index in current palette (ranging 0-63).
12 foreground is a color index in current palette (ranging 0-15). background
is a color index in current palette (ranging 0-15).
13 and up foreground is a color index in current palette (ranging 0-255).
background is a color index in current palette (ranging 0-255).

If you are using a color depth higher than 8bpp, foreground and background are
direct `RGB` color values in the form `&hAARRGGBB`, where `AA`, `RR`, `GG` and
`BB` are the alpha, red, green and blue components ranging `&h00`-`&hFF`
(`0`-`255` in decimal notation). While in hi/truecolor modes, you can use the
`RGB` or `RGBA` macro to obtain a valid color value.
A `Default Palette` is automatically set when entering a `Screen` mode.

Examples:

' Sets 320x240 in 32bpp color depth
Screen 14, 32

' Sets orange foreground and dark blue background color
Color RGB(255, 128, 0), RGB(0, 0, 64)

' Clears the screen to the background color
Cls

' Prints "Hello World!" in the middle of the screen
Locate 15, 14
Print "Hello World!"

Sleep



Dim c As Ulong

'retrieve current color values
c = Color()

'extract color values from c using LOWORD and HIWORD
Print "Console colors:"
Print "Foreground: " & LoWord(c)
Print "Background: " & HiWord(c)



' In 32-bit color depth, Function Color() returns only the foreground color

#include "fbgfx.bi"

Differences from QB:
  * Direct color modes were not supported in QB.
  * There is no border argument.
