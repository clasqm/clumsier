DEFINED
================

Preprocessor function to test if a symbol has been defined

Syntax:
defined (symbol_name)

Parameters:

`symbol_name`
Name of the symbol to test

Return Value:
Returns non-zero (`-1`) if the symbol has been defined, otherwise returns zero
(`0`).

Description:

Given the symbol name, the `defined()` preprocessor function returns true if
the symbol has been defined - or false if the symbol is unknown.

This is used mainly with `#if`.

Similar to `#ifdef` except it allows more than one check to occur because of
its flexibility.

Examples:

'e.g. - which symbols are defined out of a, b, c, and d ?

Const a = 300
#define b 12
Dim c As Single

#if defined(a)
 Print "a is defined"
#endif
#if defined(b)
 Print "b is defined"
#endif
#if defined(c)
 Print "c is defined"
#endif
#if defined(d)
 Print "d is defined"
#endif
