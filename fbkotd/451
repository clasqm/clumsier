CONDDESTROY
================

Destroys a multi-threading conditional variable when it is no more needed

Syntax:
declare sub Conddestroy ( byval handle as any ptr )

Usage:
Conddestroy ( handle )

Parameters:

`handle`

The handle of a conditional variable to destroy.

Description:

Once the conditional is `Condcreate`d and the threads are started, one of more
of them (including the implicit main thread executing main program) can be set
to `Condwait` for the conditional, they will be stopped until some other
thread `Condsignal`s that the waiting thread can restart. `Condbroadcast` can
be used to restart all threads waiting for the conditional. At the end of the
program `Conddestroy` must be used to avoid leaking resources in the OS.

Conddestroy destroys a condition variable, freeing the resources it might
hold. No threads must be waiting on the condition variable on entrance to
Conddestroy.

Examples:

See `Condcreate`, `Condwait` and `Condsignal`

Platform Differences:

  * Conddestroy is not available with the DOS version / target of FreeBASIC,
  because multithreading is not supported by DOS kernel nor the used extender.

Dialect Differences:
Threading is not allowed in -lang qb

Differences from QB:
New to FreeBASIC
