Operator Shl= (Shift left and Assign)
================

Shifts left and assigns a value to a variable

Syntax:
declare operator Shl= ( byref lhs as integer, byref rhs as integer )
declare operator Shl= ( byref lhs as uinteger, byref rhs as uinteger )
declare operator Shl= ( byref lhs as longint, byref rhs as longint )
declare operator Shl= ( byref lhs as ulongint, byref rhs as ulongint )

Usage:
lhs shl= rhs

Parameters:

`lhs`
The variable to assign to.

`rhs`
The value to shift `lhs` left by.

Description:

This operator shifts the bits in its left-hand side (`lhs`) parameter a number
of times specified by its right-hand side (`rhs`) parameter, and assigns the
result to `lhs`. It is functionally equivalent to:

`lhs = lhs Shl rhs`

This operator can be overloaded for user-defined types as a member `Operator`
using the appropriate syntax.

Note: Similarly to the operator '=[>]' (assign), the alternative symbol
'Shl=>' can be also used.

Examples:

Dim i As Integer
i = &b00000011   '' = 3
i Shl= 3         '' = i*2^3
'' Result: 11000          24            24
Print Bin(i), i, 3*2^3
Sleep


Dialect Differences:
Not available in the -lang qb dialect unless referenced with the
alias `__Shl=`.

Differences from QB:
New to FreeBASIC
