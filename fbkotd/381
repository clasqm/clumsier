Operator + (String concatenation)
================

Concatenates two strings

Syntax:
declare operator + ( byref lhs as string, byref rhs as string ) as string
declare operator + ( byref lhs as zstring, byref rhs as zstring ) as zstring
declare operator + ( byref lhs as wstring, byref rhs as wstring ) as wstring

Usage:
result = lhs + rhs

Parameters:

`lhs`
The left-hand side string to concatenate.

`rhs`
The right-hand side string to concatenate.

Description:

This operator concatenates two strings. Unlike Operator & (String
concatenation with conversion) both expressions must be strings, and may not
be converted (in fact, any attempt to concatenate a string with a non-string
or two non-strings will result in a type mismatch error, with the exception of
when operator overloading is used in a UDT).

Examples:

Dim As String a = "Hello, ", b = "World!"
Dim As String c
c = a + b
Print c

Output:
    Hello, World!


Differences from QB:
