Operator EQV (Equivalence)
================

Returns the bitwise-and (equivalence) of two numeric values

Syntax:
declare operator Eqv ( byref lhs as T1, byref rhs as T2 ) as Ret

Usage:
result = lhs Eqv rhs

Parameters:

`lhs`
The left-hand side expression.

`T1`
Any numeric or boolean type.

`rhs`
The right-hand side expression.

`T2
Any numeric or boolean type.

`Ret`
A numeric or boolean type (varies with `T1` and `T2`).

Return Value:
Returns the bitwise-equivalence of the two operands.

Description:

This operator returns the bitwise-equivalence of its operands, a logical
operation that results in a value with bits set depending on the bits of the
operands (for conversion of a boolean to an integer, false or true boolean
value becomes 0 or -1 integer value).

The truth table below demonstrates all combinations of a boolean-equivalence
operation:

Lhs Bit Rhs Bit Result
0 0 1
1 0 0
0 1 0
1 1 1


No short-circuiting is performed - both expressions are always evaluated.

The return type depends on the types of values passed. `Byte`, `Ubyte` and
floating-point type values are first converted to `Integer`. If the left and
right-hand side types differ only in signedness, then the return type is the
same as the left-hand side type (`T1`), otherwise, the larger of the two types
is returned. Only if the left and right-hand side types are both `Boolean`,
the return type is also `Boolean`.

This operator can be overloaded for user-defined types.

Examples:

Dim As UByte a = &b00110011
Dim As UByte b = &b01010101, c
c = a Eqv b '' c = &b10011001


Dialect Differences:
In the -lang qb dialect, this operator cannot be overloaded.

Differences from QB:
  * None
