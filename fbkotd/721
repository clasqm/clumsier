OPEN CONS
================

Opens the console's standard input (stdin) or output (stdout) streams for use
in file operations.

Syntax:
Open Cons As [#]filenumber
Open Cons For Input As [#]filenumber
Open Cons For Output As [#]filenumber

Usage:
result = Open Cons( [For {Input|Output}[,]] As filenumber )

`(or using the QB-like syntax,)`

Open Cons [For {Input|Output}] As filenumber

Parameters:

`filenumber`
An available file number to bind to the stdin or stdout stream, which can be
found with `Freefile`.

Return Value:
In the first usage, `Open Cons()` returns a 32 bit `Long`: a zero (0) on
success and a non-zero error code otherwise.

Description:

`Open Cons` opens the console's stdin or stdout streams for reading or
writing. A file number is bound to the stream, which is used in subsequent
file operations, such as `Input #`. An available file number can be retrieved
with `Freefile`.

The `Input` file mode opens the stdin stream for reading file operations, such
as `Line Input #`, while the `Output` file mode opens the stdout stream for
writing file operations, such as `Print #`. The `Output` file mode is the
default if not specified.

The stdin and stdout streams are the ones used when the calling process' input
or output is redirected (piped) by OS commands, or when it is opened with
`Open Pipe`.

To open both the stdin and stdout streams for file operations, a process must
use multiple file numbers.

The error code returned by `Open Cons` can be checked using `Err` in the next
line. The function version of `Open Cons` returns directly the error code as a
32 bit `Long`.

Warning: Presently, `Open Cons` does not work as described above. Without any
file mode specifier, a runtime error 1 (illegal function call) occurs. With
the `Input` file mode specifier, the only input mode is well supported. But
with the `Output` file mode specifier, input and output modes are
simultaneously supported.

Runtime errors:

`Open Cons` throws one of the following runtime errors:

(`1`) Illegal function call

  * `filenumber` was not free at the time. use `Freefile` to ensure 
  that `filenumber` is free.

Examples:

Dim a As String

Open Cons For Input As #1
Open Cons For Output As #2

Print #2,"Please write something and press ENTER"
Line Input #1,a
Print #2, "You wrote : ";a

Close
Sleep


Differences from QB:
  * In QB the syntax was `OPEN "CON:" FOR INPUT|OUTPUT AS [#] filenumber`
