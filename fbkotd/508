ABS
================

Calculates the absolute value of a number

Syntax:
declare function Abs ( byval number as integer ) as integer
declare function Abs ( byval number as uinteger ) as uinteger
declare function Abs ( byval number as double ) as double

Usage:
result = Abs( number )

Parameters:

`number`
Value to find the absolute value of.

Return Value:
The absolute value of `number`.

Description:

The absolute value of a number is its positive magnitude. If a number is
negative, its value will be negated and the positive result returned. For
example, `Abs(-1)` and `Abs(1)` both return `1`. The required `number`
argument can be any valid numeric expression.
Unsigned numbers will be treated as if they were signed, i.e. if the highest
bit is set the number will be treated as negative, and its value negated.
The value returned will be greater than or equal to `0`, with the exception of
signed integers containing the lowest possible negative value that can be
stored in its type, in which case negating it will overflow the result.

The `Abs` unary `operator` can be overloaded with user defined types.

Examples:

Dim n As Integer

Print Abs( -1 )
Print Abs( -3.1415 )
Print Abs( 42 )
Print Abs( n )

n = -69

Print Abs( n )

Output:

 
 
    1
    3.1415
    42
    0
    69


Dialect Differences:
In the -lang qb dialect, this operator cannot be overloaded.
