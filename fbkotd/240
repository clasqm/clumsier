__FB_DOS__
================

Intrinsic define set by the compiler

Syntax:
__FB_DOS__

Description:
Define without a value created at compile time if compiling for the DOS
target. Default in the DOS hosted version, or active when the -target dos
command line option is used. It can be used to compile parts of the program
only if the target is DOS. Note: the DOS hosted version cannot compile to
other targets than DOS by now.

Examples:

#IFDEF __FB_DOS__
  ' ... instructions only for DOS ...
  ' ... INT 0x31
#ELSE
  ' ... instructions not for DOS ...
#ENDIF
