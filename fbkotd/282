#IF
================

Preprocessor conditional directive

Syntax:
#if (expression)
' Conditionally included statements
#endif

Description:
Conditionally includes statements at compile time.

Statements contained within the `#if` / `#endif` block are included if
`expression` evaluates to True (non-zero) and excluded (ignored) if
`expression` evaluates to False (`0`).

This conditional directive differs from the `If` conditional statement in that
`#if` is evaluated at compile-time and `If` is evaluated at run-time.

Examples:

#define DEBUG_LEVEL 1
#IF (DEBUG_LEVEL >= 2)
  ' This line is not compiled since the expression is False
  Print "Starting application"
#ENDIF
