Operator OR (Inclusive Disjunction)
================

Returns the bitwise-or (inclusive disjunction) of two numeric values

Syntax:
declare operator Or ( byref lhs as T1, byref rhs as T2 ) as Ret

Usage:
result = lhs Or rhs

Parameters:

`lhs`
The left-hand side expression.

`T1`
Any numeric or boolean type.

`rhs`
The right-hand side expression.

`T2
Any numeric or boolean type.

`Ret`
A numeric or boolean type (varies with `T1` and `T2`).

Return Value:
Returns the bitwise-disjunction of the two operands.

Description:

This operator returns the bitwise-disjunction of its operands, a logical
operation that results in a value with bits set depending on the bits of the
operands (for conversion of a boolean to an integer, false or true boolean
value becomes 0 or -1 integer value).

The truth table below demonstrates all combinations of a boolean-disjunction
operation:

Lhs Bit Rhs Bit Result
0 0 0
1 0 1
0 1 1
1 1 1


No short-circuiting is performed - both expressions are always evaluated.

The return type depends on the types of values passed. `Byte`, `Ubyte` and
floating-point type values are first converted to `Integer`. If the left and
right-hand side types differ only in signedness, then the return type is the
same as the left-hand side type (`T1`), otherwise, the larger of the two types
is returned. Only if the left and right-hand side types are both `Boolean`,
the return type is also `Boolean`.

This operator can be overloaded for user-defined types.

Examples:

' Using the OR operator on two numeric values
Dim As UByte numeric_value1, numeric_value2
numeric_value1 = 15 '00001111
numeric_value2 = 30 '00011110

'Result =  31  =     00011111
Print numeric_value1 Or numeric_value2
Sleep



' Using the OR operator on two conditional expressions
Dim As UByte numeric_value
numeric_value = 10

If numeric_value = 5 Or numeric_value = 10 Then Print "Numeric_Value equals 5
or 10"
Sleep

' This will output "Numeric_Value equals 5 or 10" because
' while the first condition of the first IF statement is false, the second is
true


Dialect Differences:
In the -lang qb dialect, this operator cannot be overloaded.

Differences from QB:
