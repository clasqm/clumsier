Operator -= (Subtract and Assign)
================

Subtracts and assigns a value to a variable

Syntax:
declare operator -= ( byref lhs as T1, byref rhs as T2 )
declare operator -= ( byref lhs as T ptr, byref rhs as integer )

Usage:
lhs -= rhs

Parameters:

`lhs`
The variable to assign to.

`T1`
Any numeric type.

`rhs`
The value to subtract from `lhs`.

`T2`
Any numeric type.

`T`
Any data type.

Description:

This operator subtracts and assigns a value to a variable. It is functionally
equivalent to:

`lhs = lhs - rhs`

For numeric types, the right-hand side expression (`rhs`) will be converted to
the left-hand side type (`T1`).

This operator can be overloaded for user-defined types as a member `Operator`
using the appropriate syntax.

Note: Similarly to the operator '=[>]' (assign), the alternative symbol '-=>'
can be also used.

Examples:

Dim n As Double
n = 6
n -= 2.2
Print n
Sleep

Output:

    3.8

Dialect Differences:
In the -lang qb dialect, this operator cannot be overloaded.
