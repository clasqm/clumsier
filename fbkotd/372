GOSUB
================

Control flow statement to use a section of code and return.

Syntax:
Gosub label

Description:
Execution jumps to a subroutine marked by a line label. Always use `Return` to
exit a `Gosub`, execution will continue on next statement after `Gosub`.

The line label where `Gosub` jumps must be in the same main/function/sub block
as `Gosub`. All the variables in the subroutine are shared with the block, no
arguments can be used. For this reason Gosub is considered bad programming
practice as it can generate unreadable and untraceable code. It is better to
use `Sub` or `Function` instead.

Examples:

'' Compile with -lang qb

'$lang: "qb"

GoSub message
End

message:
Print "Welcome!"
Return

Dialect Differences:
Only available in the -lang qb and -lang fblite dialects.
  * `Gosub` support is disabled by default in the -lang fblite unless the
  `Option Gosub` statement is used.

Differences from QB:
  * None when using the -lang qb dialect.
