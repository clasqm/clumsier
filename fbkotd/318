ON...GOTO
================

Jumps to a label based on an expression.

Syntax:
On expression Goto label1[, ...]

Description:
Branches to different labels depending on the value of expression. An
expression value of 1 will branch to the first label, a value of 2 to the
second, etc. If the value of expression is zero (0) or greater than the number
of items in the list, execution continues on the next statement following the
`On...Goto`.

It is recommended that the structured `Select Case` conditional statement be
used instead of `On...Goto`.

Examples:

Dim choice As Integer
Input "Enter a number: ", choice
On choice Goto labela, labelb, labelc
labela:
Print "choice a"
End
labelb:
Print "choice b"
End
labelc:
Print "choice c"
End

Differences from QB:
FreeBASIC does not generate a run-time error if `expression` is negative
or greater than 255.
