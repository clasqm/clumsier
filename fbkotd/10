Bit Manipulation
================

Macros that work with the bits and bytes of numbers.

Description:
	The macros documented here provide access to the individual bits, bytes and
	words of integer values.

Byte Manipulation Macros
	Gets the value of individual bytes or words of
	Uinteger values.
LOBYTE
	Gets the least significant byte (LSB, or _lo-byte_ ) value of an
	Uinteger value.
HIBYTE]
	Gets the most significant byte (MSB, or _hi-byte_ ) value of the least
	significant word (LSW, or _lo-word_ ) of anUinteger value.
LOWORD
	Gets the least significant word (LSW, or _lo-word_ ) value of an
	Uinteger value.
HIWORD
	Gets the most significant word (LSW, or _hi-word_ ) value of an
	Uinteger value.

Bit Manipulation Macros
	Gets the state of individual bits of numeric values.
BIT
	Gets the state of an individual bit in an integer value.
BITRESET
	Gets the value of an integer with a specified bit cleared.
BITSET
	Gets the value of an integer with a specified bit set.
