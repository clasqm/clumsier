RETURN (from Gosub)
================

Control flow statement to return from a procedure or `Gosub`.

Syntax:
Return [ label ]

Description:
`Return` is used to return from a gosub `Gosub`.

Because `Return` could mean return-from-gosub or return-from-procedure,
`Option Gosub` and `Option Nogosub` can be used to enable and disable `Gosub`
support. When `Gosub` support is disabled, `Return` is then recognized as
return-from-procedure. When `Gosub` support is enabled, `Return` is then
recognized as return-from-gosub.

`Return` (from gosub) is used to return control back to the statement
immediately following a previous `Gosub` call. When used in combination with
`Gosub`, no return value can be specified. If the optional `label` is
specified, execution continues at the specified label. If no `Gosub` was made,
a runtime error is generated, and execution continues immediately after
`Return`.

A `Gosub` should always have a matching `Return` statement. However, if
`Return` (from gosub) is used where no `Gosub` was made, a run-time error is
generated.

Examples:

'' GOSUB & RETURN example, compile with "-lang qb" or use "$lang" as below

'$lang: "qb"

Print "Let's Gosub!"
GoSub MyGosub
Print "Back from Gosub!"
Sleep
End

MyGosub:
Print "In Gosub!"
Return

Dialect Differences:
In the -lang fb dialect `Return` always means return-from-procedure.
  * In the -lang qb dialect, `Return` means return-from-gosub by default 
  unless changed with `Option Nogosub`, in which case the compiler will 
  recognize `Return` as return-from-procedure.
  * In the -lang fblite dialect, `Return` means return-from-procedure 
  by default unless changed with `Option Gosub`, in which case the compiler 
  will recognize `Return` as return-from-gosub.

Differences from QB:
  * None when using the -lang qb dialect.
