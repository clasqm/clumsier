RSET
================

Right justifies a string in a string buffer

Syntax:
declare sub Rset ( byref dst as string, byref src as const string )
declare sub Rset ( byval dst as wstring ptr, byval src as const wstring ptr )

Usage:
Rset dst, src

Parameters:

`dst`
A `string` or `wstring` buffer to copy the text into.

`src`
The source `string` or `wstring` to be right justified.

Description:

`Rset` right justifies text into the string buffer `dst`, filling the right
part of the string with `src` and the left part with spaces. The string buffer
size is not modified.

If text is too long for the string buffer size, `Rset` truncates characters
from the right.

Examples:

Dim buffer As String
buffer = Space(10)
RSet buffer, "91.5"
Print "-[" & buffer & "]-"

Differences from QB:
* In QBasic the syntax was `Rset dst = src`. That syntax is also supported by FB.
