CVA_END
================

Macro to clean-up a variadic argument list object variable

Syntax:
cva_end( argument_list )

Parameters:

`argument_list`
`cva_list` variable to clean up

Description:

Cleans-up a `cva_list` type variable that was previously initialized with
`cva_start` or `cva_copy`, like a destructor.

`argument_list` must already have been initialized with a previous `cva_start`
or `cva_copy` statement in the same procedure as `cva_end` (for cross platform
compatibility).

Examples:

Sub proc CDecl(count As Integer, ... )
    Dim args As cva_list
    cva_start( args, count )
    For i As Integer = 1 To count
        Print cva_arg( args, Integer )
    Next
    cva_end( args )
End Sub

proc( 4, 4000, 300, 20, 1 )
