ERR
================

Get or set the run-time error number

Usage:
result = Err( )

or

Err = number

Description:
The `Err()` function returns the FreeBASIC run-time error number (a 32 bit
`Long`) which can be set by the built-in statements and functions, or by the
program through `Err = number` or `Error`. Unlike `Error`, `Err = number` sets
the error number without invoking an error handler.

See Runtime Error Codes for a listing of the predefined runtime error numbers
and their associated meaning. The program may use additional custom error
numbers.

`Err` can always be used, even if QB-like error handling is not enabled. `Err`
is reset by `Resume` and `Resume Next`.

Note: Care should be taken when calling an internal function (such as `Print`)
after an error occurred, because it will reset the error value with its own
error status. To preserve the `Err` value, it is a good idea to store it in a
variable as soon as the error handler is entered.

Remark: Some procedures used in their function version return directly the
error code (a 32 bit `Long`).
That is the case for: `Bload`, `Bsave`, `Close`, `FileCopy`, `GetJoystick`,
`GetMouse`, `ImageInfo`, `Kill`, `Open`, `Open Com`, `Open Cons`, `Open Err`,
`Open Lpt`, `Open Pipe`, `Open Scrn`, `ScreenRes`, `ScreenSync`, `SetDate`,
`SetMouse`, `SetTime`.

Examples:
An example using QBasic style error handling (compile with -ex option)

'' Compile with -lang fblite or qb

#lang "fblite"

On Error Goto Error_Handler
Error 150
End

Error_Handler:
  n = Err()
  Print "Error #"; n
  Resume Next

An example using inline error handling (note: `Open` can also return its own
error status when called as a function)

'' compile without -e switch

Dim filename As String

Do
    Line Input "Input filename: ", filename
    If filename = "" Then End
    Open filename For Input As #1
Loop Until Err() = 0

Print Using "File '&' opened successfully"; filename
Close #1


Differences from QB:
  * Error numbers are not the same as in QB.
