$DYNAMIC
================

Metacommand to change the way arrays are allocated

Syntax:
'$Dynamic

or

rem $Dynamic

Description:
'$Dynamic is a metacommand that specifies that any following array
declarations are variable-length, whether they are declared with constant
subscript ranges or not. This remains in effect for the rest of the module in
which '$Dynamic is used, and can be overridden with `'$Static`. It is
equivalent to the `Option Dynamic` statement.

Examples:

' compile with -lang fblite or qb
#lang "fblite"
'$DYNAMIC
Dim a(100)
'......
ReDim a(200)

Dialect Differences:
Only available in the -lang fblite and -lang qb dialects.

Differences from QB:
When used inside comments it must be the first token
