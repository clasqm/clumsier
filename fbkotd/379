Operator *= (Multiply and Assign)
================

Multiplies and assigns a value to a variable

Syntax:
declare operator *= ( byref lhs as T1, byref rhs as T2 )

Usage:
lhs *= rhs

Parameters:

`lhs`
The variable to assign to.

`T1`
Any numeric type.

`rhs`
The value to multiply `lhs` by.

`T2`
Any numeric type.

Description:

This operator multiplies and assigns a value to a variable. It is functionally
equivalent to:

`lhs = lhs * rhs`

The right-hand side expression (`rhs`) will be converted to the left-hand side
type (`T1`).

This operator can be overloaded for user-defined types as a member `Operator`
using the appropriate syntax.

Note: Similarly to the operator '=[>]' (assign), the alternative symbol '*=>'
can be also used.

Examples:

Dim n As Double
n = 6
n *= 2
Print n
Sleep

Output:


    12


Dialect Differences:
In the -lang qb dialect, this operator cannot be overloaded.

Differences from QB:
New to FreeBASIC
