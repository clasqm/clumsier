RESUME
================

Error handling statement to resume execution after a jump to an error handler

Syntax:
Resume

Description:
`Resume` is used in the traditional QB error handling mechanism within an
error handler (called by `On Error`) to return execution to the line that
caused the error. Usually this is used after the error has been handled
gracefully in order to try the previously erroneous operation again with
corrected data.

`Resume` resets the `Err` value to 0

Examples:

'' Compile with -lang fblite or qb

#lang "fblite"

Dim As Single i, j

On Error Goto ErrHandler

i = 0
j = 1 / i ' this line causes a divide-by-zero error on the first try;
execution jumps to ErrHandler label

Print j ' after the value of i is corrected, prints 0.5

End ' end the program so that execution does not fall through to the error
handler again

ErrHandler:

i = 2
Resume ' execution jumps back to 'j = 1 / i' line, which does not cause an
error this time


Dialect Differences:
RESUME is not supported in the -lang fb dialect. Statements can be used in its function form to return an error code

If Open( "text" For Input As #1 ) <> 0 Then
  Print "Unable to open file"
End If


Differences from QB:
  * Does not accept line numbers or labels
  * Must compile with -ex or -exx option
