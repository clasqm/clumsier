'Example code to demonstrate a use of __FB_ERR__
Dim err_command_line As UByte
err_command_line = __FB_ERR__
Select Case err_command_line
Case 0
Print "No Error Checking enabled on the Command Line!"
Case 1
Print "Some Error Checking enabled on the Command Line!"
Case 3
Print "QBasic style Error Checking enabled on the Command Line!"
Case 7
Print "Extreme Error Checking enabled on the Command Line!"
Case Else
Print "Some Unknown Error level has been set!"
