ERASE
================

Statement to erase arrays

Syntax:
declare sub Erase ( array as any [, ... ] )

Usage:
Erase( array0 [, array1 ... arrayN ] )

Parameters:

`array`
An array to be erased.

Description:

Using `Erase` on a fixed-length array resets all elements without freeing the
allocated memory.
In case of objects, there is destruction then re-construction.

Using `Erase` on a variable-length array (array already sized) frees the
memory allocated for the array elements, but the array remains declared at its
same scope level (with the same datatype and number of dimensions).
In case of objects, there is destruction before freeing memory.

Examples:

Dim MyArray1(1 To 10) As Integer
ReDim MyArray2(1 To 10) As Integer
Erase MyArray1, MyArray2
