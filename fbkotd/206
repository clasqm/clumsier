CLASS
===================

Declares a class object

Syntax:
Class typename ...

Parameters:
`typename`
name of the `Class`

Description:
We would have put something useful here (honest) except this feature isn't
implemented in the compiler yet. But since it will get added in future, and
there are several other document pages that need to link here, we thought it
safe to include in anyway.


Dialect Differences:

Object-related features are supported only in the -lang fb option

Differences from QB:
New to FreeBASIC
