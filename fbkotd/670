APPEND
================

Specifies text file to be opened for append mode

Syntax:
open filename for Append [encoding encoding_type] [lock lock_type] as
[#]filenum

Parameters:

`filename`

file name to open for append

`encoding_type`

indicates encoding type for the file

`lock_type`

locking to be used while the file is open

`filenum`

unused file number to associate with the open file

Description:

A file mode used with `Open` to open a text file for writing.

This mode is used to add text to an existing file with `Print #`, or comma
separated values with `Write#`.

Text files can't be simultaneously read and written in FreeBASIC, so if both
functions are required on the same file, it must be opened twice.

`filename` must be a string expression resulting in a legal file name in the
target OS, without wildcards. The file will be sought for in the present
directory, unless the `filename` contains a path . If the file does not exist,
it is created. The pointer is set after the last character of the file.

`Encoding_type` indicates the Unicode `Encoding` of the file, so characters
are correctly read. If omitted, "ascii" encoding is defaulted. Only little
endian character encodings are supported at the moment.

  * `"utf8"`
  * `"utf16"`
  * `"utf32"`
  * `"ascii"` (the default)

`Lock_type` indicates the way the file is locked for other processes, it is
one of:

  * `Read` \- the file can be opened simultaneously by other processes, 
  but not for reading
  * `Write` \- the file can be opened simultaneously by other processes, 
  but not for writing
  * `Read Write` \- the file cannot be opened simultaneously by other 
  processes (the default)

`filenum` Is a valid FreeBASIC file number (in the range `1..255`) not being
used for any other file presently open. The file number identifies the file
for the rest of file operations. A free file number can be found using the
`Freefile` function.

Examples:

Dim i As Integer
For i = 1 To 10
    Open "test.txt" For Append As #1
    Print #1, "extending test.txt"
    Close #1
Next
