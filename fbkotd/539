VALINT
================

Converts a string to a 32bit integer

Syntax:
declare function Valint ( byref strnum as const string ) as long
declare function Valint ( byref strnum as const wstring ) as long

Usage:
result = Valint ( strnum )

Parameters:

`strnum`
the string to convert

Return Value:
Returns a `Long` value of the converted string

If the first character of the string is invalid, `Valint` will return `0`.

Description:

For example, `Valint("10")` will return `10`, and `Valint("10.60")` will
return `10` as well. The function parses the string from the left, skipping
any white space, and returns the longest number it can read, stopping at the
first non-suitable character it finds. Any non-numeric characters, including
decimal points and exponent specifiers, are considered non-suitable, for
example, `Valint("23.1E+6")` will just return `23`.

`Valint` can be used to convert integer numbers in binary / octal /
hexadecimal format, if they have the relevant identifier (`"&B"` / `"&O"` /
`"&H"`) prefixed, for example: `Valint("&HFF")` returns `255`.

If you want to convert a number into string format, use the `Str` function.

Examples:

Dim a As String, b As Integer
a = "20xa211"
b = ValInt(a)
Print a, b
 
    20xa211   20

alias `__Valint`.
