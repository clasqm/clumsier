SETTIME
================

Sets the current system time

Syntax:
declare function Settime ( byref newtime as const string ) as long

Usage:
result = Settime( newtime )

Parameters:

`newtime`
the new time to set

Return Value:
Returns zero on success or non-zero on failure on all ports except DOS.

Description:

To set the time, format the date and send to `Settime` in one of the following
formats: `"hh:mm:ss"`, `"hh:mm"`, or `"hh"` (`hh` is the hour, `mm` is the
minute, and `ss` is the second).

The error code returned by `Settime` can be checked using `Err` in the next
line. The function version of `Settime` returns directly the error code as a
32 bit `Long`.

Examples:

SetTime "1:20:30"

Platform Differences:

  * On Windows the privilege SE_SYSTEMTIME_NAME is required, which
  typically means that the calling process has to be run with administrator
  privileges.
  * On Linux the capability CAP_SYS_TIME is required, which typically
  means that the calling process has to be run as root/superuser.

Differences from QB:
  * The `Time` statement was used QB and the syntax was `TIME = newtime`.
