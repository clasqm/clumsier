Compiler Option: -eassert
==========================

Enable `assert()` and `assertwarn()` checking

Syntax:
-eassert

Description:
The `-eassert` compiler option enables `Assert` and `AssertWarn` code
generation.
`-eassert` is automatically implied by the `-g` option.
`__FB_ERR__` can be used to determine in user source code if the `-eassert`
option was specified or implied on the command line.
