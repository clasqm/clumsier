Operator += (Add and Assign)
================

Adds and assigns a value to a variable

Syntax:
declare operator += ( byref lhs as T1, byref rhs as T2 )

declare operator += ( byref lhs as T ptr, byref rhs as integer )

declare operator += ( byref lhs as string, byref rhs as string )
declare operator += ( byref lhs as wstring, byref rhs as wstring )

Usage:
lhs += rhs

Parameters:

`lhs`
The variable to assign to.

`T1`
Any numeric type.

`rhs`
The value to add to `lhs`.

`T2`
Any numeric type.

`T`
Any data type.

Description:

This operator adds and assigns a value to a variable. It is functionally
equivalent to:


lhs = lhs + rhs


For numeric types, the right-hand side expression (`rhs`) will be converted to
the left-hand side type (`T1`).

For string types, this operator is functionally equivalent to `Operator &=
(Concatenate and assign)`.

This operator can be overloaded for user-defined types as a member `Operator`
using the appropriate syntax.

Note: Similarly to the operator '=[>]' (assign), the alternative symbol '+=>'
can be also used.

Examples:

Dim n As Double
n = 6
n += 1
Print n
Sleep

Output:

 
 
    7


Dialect Differences:
In the -lang qb dialect, this operator cannot be overloaded.
