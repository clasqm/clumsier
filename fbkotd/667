#INCLUDE
================

Preprocessor statement to include contents of another source file

Syntax:
#include [once] "file"

Description:
`#include` inserts source code from another file at the point where the
`#include` directive appears. This has the effect of compiling the source code
from the include file as though it were part of the source file that includes
it. Once the compiler has reached the end of the include file, the original
source file continues to be compiled.

This is useful to remove code from a file and separate it into more files. It
is useful to have a single file with declarations in a program formed by
several modules. You may include files within an include file, although avoid
including the original file into itself, this will not produce valid results.
Typically, include files will have an extension of `.bi` and are mainly used
for declaring subs/functions/variables of a library, but any valid source code
may be present in an include file.

The `once` specifier tells the compiler to include the file only once even if
it is included several times by the source code.

`$Include` is an alternative form of `include`, existing only for
compatibility with QuickBASIC. It is recommended to use `#include` instead.

The compiler will automatically convert path separator characters ( '`/`' and
'`\`' ) as needed to properly load the file. The filename name may be an
absolute or relative path.

For relative paths, or where no path is given at all, the include file is
search for in the following order:

  * Relative from the directory of the source file
  * Relative from the current working directory
  * Relative from addition directories specified with the -i command line 
  option
  * The include folder of the FreeBASIC installation (`FreeBASIC\inc`, 
  where `FreeBASIC` is the folder where the `fbc` executable is located)

Examples:

' header.bi file
Type FooType
    Bar As Byte
    Barbeque As Byte
End Type



' main.bas file
#INCLUDE "header.bi"

Dim Foo As FooType

Foo.Bar = 1
Foo.Barbeque = 2
