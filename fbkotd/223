Compiler Option: -edebug
================

Enable `__FB_DEBUG__`

Syntax:
-edebug

Description:
The `-edebug` compiler option defines the intrinsic macro `__FB_DEBUG__` to
enable user debug code.

The intrinsic macro `__FB_DEBUG__` is set to non-zero (-1) if the option was
specified, and set to zero (0) otherwise.

`-edebug` is automatically implied by the `-g` option.

`__FB_ERR__` can be used to determine in user source code if the `-edebug`
option was specified or implied on the command line.
