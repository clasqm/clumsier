Compiler Option: -b
================

Add a source file to compilation

Syntax:
[ -b ] < source file >

Parameters:

`source file`
The name with extension, and optionally a path, of the basic source file.

Description:
The `-b` option adds a source file to the compilation list. In general, this
option is redundant since source files with a .bas extension can be specified
without it, but is useful if a source file does not have a .bas extension, or
if exists in an other directory.

To compile and link the source files file1.bas, file2.bas and file3.fb into an
executable (file1.exe in DOS/Windows, file1 in Linux), type,

`fbc -b file1.bas file2.bas -b file3.fb`

Note that the `-b` option was not needed for file1.bas or file2.bas.
