PUBLIC: (Access Control)
================

Specifies public member access control in a `Type` or `Class`

Syntax:
Type typename

Public:

member declarations

End Type

Parameters:

`typename`
name of the `Type` or `Class`

`member declarations`
declarations for fields, functions, or enumerations

Description:

`Public:` indicates that `member declarations` following it have public
access. Public members are accessible with any usage of the `Type` or `Class`.

`member declarations` following `Public:` are public until a different access
control specifier is given, like `Private:` or `Protected:`

Members in a `Type` declaration are `Public:` by default if no member access
control specifier is given.

Examples:

Type testing
  Private:
    nome As String
  Public:
    number As Integer
  Declare Sub setNome( ByRef newnome As String )
End Type

Sub testing.setnome( ByRef newnome As String )
  This.nome = newnome
End Sub

Dim As testing myVariable

'' We can access these members anywhere since
'' they're public
myVariable.number = 69 ''
myVariable.setNome( "FreeBASIC" )
