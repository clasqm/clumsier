PUBLIC
================

Specifies a procedure having external linkage.

Syntax:
Public Sub procedure_name [Cdecl|Stdcall|Pascal] [Overload] [Alias
"external_name"] [([parameter_list])] [Constructor [priority]] [Static]
[Export]
..procedure body..
End Sub

Public Function procedure_name [Cdecl|Stdcall|Pascal] [Overload] [Alias
"external_name"] [([parameter_list])] [ byref ] as return_type [Static]
[Export]
..procedure body..
End Function

Description:
In procedure definitions (forbidden at declaration line level), `Public`
specifies that a procedure has external linkage, meaning its name is visible
to external modules. If `Public` or `Private` is not specified, a procedure is
defined as if `Public` was specified.

Examples:

Private Sub i_am_private
End Sub  
Public Sub i_am_public
End Sub
