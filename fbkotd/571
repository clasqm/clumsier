`Write`

Description:

`Access` is used with the `Open` statement to request read, write, or read and

assumed.

Examples:

This example shows how to open the file "data.raw" with `read` and then
"data.out" with `write` access, in `Binary` mode, in an open file number
returned by `FreeFile`.

Dim As Integer o

  '' get an open file number.
  o = FreeFile
 
  '' open file for read-only access.
  Open "data.raw" For Binary Access Read As #o
   
    '' make a buffer in memory thats the entire size of the file
    Dim As UByte file_char( LOF( o ) \- 1 )

      '' get the file into the buffer.     
      Get #o, , file_char()
   
  Close
 
  '' get another open file number.
  o = FreeFile
 
  '' open file for write-only access.
  Open "data.out" For Binary Access Write As #o

    '' put the buffer into the new file.     
    Put #o, , file_char()
   
  Close

  Print "Copied file ""data.raw"" to file ""data.out"""
