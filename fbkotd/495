XOR
================

Parameter to the `Put` graphics statement which uses a bit-wise `Xor` as the
blitting method

Syntax:
Put [ target, ] [ STEP ] ( x,y ), source [ ,( x1,y1 )-( x2,y2 ) ], Xor

Parameters:

`Xor`
Required.

Description:

The `Xor` method combines each source pixel with the corresponding destination
pixel, using the bit-wise `Xor` function. The result of this is output as the
destination pixel.
This method works in all graphics modes. There is no mask color, although
color values of `0` (`RGBA(0, 0, 0, 0)` in full-color modes) will have no
effect, because of the behavior of `Xor`.

In full-color modes, each component (red, green, blue and alpha) is kept in a
discrete set of bits, so the operation can be made to only affect some of the
channels, by making sure the all the values of the other channels are set to
`0`.

Examples:

''open a graphics window
ScreenRes 320, 200, 16

''create a sprite containing a circle
Const As Integer r = 32
Dim c As Any Ptr = ImageCreate(r * 2 \+ 1, r * 2 \+ 1, 0)
Circle c, (r, r), r, RGBA(255, 255, 255, 0), , , 1, f

''put the three sprites, overlapping each other in the middle
Put (146 \- r, 108 \- r), c, Xor
Put (174 \- r, 108 \- r), c, Xor
Put (160 \- r,  84 \- r), c, Xor

''free the memory used by the sprite
ImageDestroy c

''pause the program before closing
Sleep
