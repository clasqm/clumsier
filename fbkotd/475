Operator PROCPTR (Procedure pointer)
================

Returns the address of a procedure

Syntax:
declare operator Procptr ( byref lhs as T ) as T ptr

Usage:
result = Procptr ( lhs )

Parameters:

`lhs`
A procedure.

`T`

The type of procedure.

Return Value:
Returns the address of the procedure.

Description:

This operator returns the address of a `Sub` or `Function` procedure.

`Operator @ (Address of)`, when used with procedures, has identical behavior.

Examples:

' This example uses ProcPtr to demonstrate function pointers
Declare Function Subtract( x As Integer, y As Integer) As Integer
Declare Function Add( x As Integer, y As Integer) As Integer
Dim myFunction As Function( x As Integer, y As Integer) As Integer

' myFunction will now be assigned to Add
myFunction = ProcPtr( Add )
Print myFunction(2, 3)

' myFunction will now be assigned to Subtract.  Notice the different output.
myFunction = ProcPtr( Subtract )
Print myFunction(2, 3)

Function Add( x As Integer, y As Integer) As Integer
    Return x + y
End Function

Function Subtract( x As Integer, y As Integer) As Integer
    Return x - y
End Function
