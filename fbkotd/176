Compiler Option: -earray
==========================
Enable array bounds checking

Syntax:
-earray

Description:
Add array bounds error checking in generated run-time code. A run-time error
is generated if an array index attempts to access an array element that is
outside the bounds of the array.

-earray` is automatically implied by the `-exx` option.

`__FB_ERR__` can be used to determine in user source code if the `-earray`
option was specified or implied on the command line.
