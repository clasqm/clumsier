DEFUINT
================

Specifies a default data type for a range of variable names

Syntax:
Defuint start_letter[-end_letter ][, ...]

Parameters:

`start_letter`
the first letter in the range

`end_letter`
the last letter in the range

Description:
`Defuint` specifies that variables and arrays which aren't declared with a
data type - or not declared at all - are implicitly declared of type
`Uinteger` if the first letter of their names matches a certain letter or lies
within an inclusive range of letters.

Examples:

This will make `uNumber` a `Uinteger` number since its first letter starts
with `u`.

'' Compile with -lang fblite
#lang "fblite"
DefInt u
Dim uNumber

Dialect Differences:
Available in the -lang fblite dialect.
  * Not available in the -lang qb dialect unless referenced with the
alias `__Defuint`.

Differences from QB:
