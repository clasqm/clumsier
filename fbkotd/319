__FB_ARGV__
================

Intrinsic define (macro value) set by the compiler

Syntax:
__FB_ARGV__

Description:
Substituted with a pointer to a list of pointers to the zero terminated
command line arguments passed in on the command line.

__FB_ARGV__ is the name of a parameter passed to the program's implicit main
function, and therefore is only defined in the module level code of the main
module for an application.

Examples:

Declare Function main _
  ( _
    ByVal argc As Integer, _
    ByVal argv As ZString Ptr Ptr _
  ) As Integer

  End main( __FB_ARGC__, __FB_ARGV__ )
Private Function main _
  ( _
    ByVal argc As Integer, _
    ByVal argv As ZString Ptr Ptr _
  ) As Integer

  Dim i As Integer
  For i = 0 To argc - 1
        Print "arg "; i; " = '"; *argv[i]; "'"
  Next i
   Return 0
 End Function
