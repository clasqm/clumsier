OPEN LPT
================

Open a printer device

Syntax:
Open Lpt ["[LPT[x]:][Printer_Name][,TITLE=Doc_Title][,EMU=TTY]"] [For
Input|Output] as #filenumber

Usage:
Open Lpt "LPT..." as [#]filenumber

or

result = Open Lpt( "LPT..."[,] as [#]filenumber )

Parameters:

`x`
Specifies a port number. If omitted, output is sent to the system print
spooler.

`Printer_Name`
Name of printer to open. This parameter is ignored on DOS.

`TITLE=Doc_Title`
Title of the print job as seen by the printer spooler. This parameter is
ignored on DOS.

`EMU=TTY`
Emulation of TTY output on a windows GDI printer, using driver text imaging.
This parameter is ignored on DOS and Linux.

`For Input|Output`
clause is allowed for compatibility, but it is ignored.

`filenumber`
An unused file number to assign to the device.

Return Value:
A 32 bit `Long`: `0` is returned if `Open Lpt()` completed successfully,
otherwise a non-zero value is returned to indicate failure.

Description:

`Open Lpt` opens a connection to a printer device. The connection is treated
like a file, so data may be written to the printer using `Print` and `Put #`
commands.

Any printer attached to the system may be opened with `Open Lpt`

`Open Lpt "LPT:" ...` will try to open the default printer on Windows and
Linux, and `"LPT1:"` on DOS.

`Lprint` will automatically try to open the default printer on Windows and
Linux, and `"LPT1:"` on DOS.

The error code returned by `Open Lpt` can be checked using `Err` in the next
line. The function version of `Open Lpt` returns directly the error code as a
32 bit `Long`.

Platform specific notes:


##Windows

The argument `EMU=TTY` assumes printable ASCII or Unicode text, and applies
printer driver text imaging to the input. `EMU=TTY` also allows the usage of
CR, LF, BS, TAB, FF, etc., for virtual print-head movement...even when the
printer is a GDI printer and therefore doesn't itself understand these special
characters. If `",EMU=TTY"` is omitted, the data must be sent in the printer's
language (ESC/P, HPGL, PostScript, etc...). Other useful emulation modes
aren't supported yet.

##Linux

A printer spooler available through `lp` must be installed to access printers
by name or a default printer. Spooler access was tested only with CUPS, but
other spoolers may work that are invoked through `lp`. Port are zero-based on
Linux. `"LPT1:"` corresponds with `"/dev/lp0"`.

The data must be sent in the printer's language (ESC/P, HPGL, PostScript,
etc...). Emulation modes aren't supported yet.

##DOS

FreeBASIC does not support print spoolers on DOS. Printers must be accessible
through `"LPTx:"`.

The data must be sent in the printer's language (ESC/P, HPGL, PostScript,
etc...). Emulation modes aren't supported yet.

Examples:

' Send some text to the Windows printer on LPT1:, using driver text imaging.
Open Lpt "LPT1:EMU=TTY" For Output  As #1
Print #1, "Testing!"
Close


' Sends contents of text file test.txt to Windows printer named
"ReceiptPrinter"
Dim RptInput As String
Dim PrintFileNum As Integer, RptFileFileNum As Integer

RptFileFileNum = FreeFile
Open "test.txt" For Input As #RptFileFileNum

PrintFileNum = FreeFile
Open Lpt "LPT:ReceiptPrinter,TITLE=ReceiptWinTitle,EMU=TTY" As _
    #PrintFilenum

While (EOF(RptFileFileNum) = 0)
        Line Input #RptFileFileNum, RptInput
        Print #PrintFileNum, RptInput
Wend

Close #PrintFileNum  ' Interestingly, does not require CHR(12).  But if
pagination is desired, CHR(12) is the way.

Close #RptFileFileNum

Print "Press any key to end program..."
GetKey

End



'This simple program will print a PostScript file to a PostScript compatible
printer.
Dim As UByte FFI, PPO
Dim As String temp

FFI = FreeFile()
Open "sample.ps" For Input Access Read As #FFI
PPO = FreeFile()
Open Lpt "LPT1:" For Output As #PPO
While (EOF(FFI) = 0)
Line Input #FFI, temp
Print #PPO, temp
Wend

Close #FFI
Close #PPO

Print "Printing Completed!"


Dialect Differences:
In the -lang qb dialect the old syntax is supported OPEN "LPT:..." . 
This syntax used in the other dialects will open a regular file.
