OPTION BASE
================

Specifies a default lower bound for array declarations

Syntax:
Option Base base_subscript

Parameters:

`base_subscript`
an numeric literal value

Description:

`Option Base` is a statement that sets the default lower bound for any
following array declarations. This default remains in effect for the rest of
the module in which `Option Base` is used, and can be overridden by declaring
arrays with an explicit lower bound, or with another `Option Base` statement.

Note: initially, the default base is `0`.

Examples:

'' Compile with the "-lang qb" or "-lang fblite" compiler switches

#lang "fblite"

Dim foo(10) As Integer      ' declares an array with indices 0-10

Option Base 5

Dim bar(15) As Integer      ' declares an array with indices 5-15
Dim baz(0 To 4) As Integer  ' declares an array with indices 0-4


Dialect Differences:
Only available in the -lang fblite and -lang qb dialects.
  * In -lang fb, `Option Base` is not allowed, and the default lower 
  bound is always `0`.

Differences from QB:
  * QBASIC only supported values of `0` or `1` for `base_subscript`.
  * In QBASIC the word `Base` was a reserved keyword, and couldn't be used 
  as a variable name.
  * Arrays must always be explicitly created in FreeBASIC. QBASIC would 
  implicitly create an array from `base_subscript` to `10` if one was used 
  in code without being predefined.
