Indexing Operators
================

Operators that return references based on an index

The indexing operators return references to some memory based on the value of
their second, or right-hand side, operand. This operand is used as an index,
or offset, from the beginning of some memory represented by the first, or
left-hand side, operand.

Operator () (Array index)
	Returns a reference to an element in an array.

Operator [] (String index)
	Returns a reference to the numeric value of a character in a string.

Operator [] (Pointer index)
	Returns a reference to memory offset from a base address.
