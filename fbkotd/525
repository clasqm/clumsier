RESET
================

Closes all open files, or resets standard I/O handles.

Syntax:
declare sub Reset ( )
declare sub Reset ( byval streamno as long )

Usage:
Reset

or

Reset( streamno )

Parameters:

`streamno`
The stream number to reset, `0` for stdin or `1` for stdout.

Description:

`Reset`, when called with no arguments, closes all disk files.

`Reset`, when called with the `streamno` argument, will reset the redirected
or piped streams associated with stdin (`0`), or stdout (`1`).

Runtime errors:

`Reset(streamno)` can set one of the following runtime errors:

(`1`) Illegal function call

  * `streamno` was neither `0` nor `1`

(`3`) File I/O error

  * Resetting of stdin or stdout failed

Examples:

Open "test.txt" For Output As #1
Print #1, "testing 123"
Reset



Dim x As String

'' Read from STDIN from piped input
Open Cons For Input As #1
While EOF(1) = 0
  Input #1, x
  Print """"; x; """"
Wend
Close #1

'' Reset to read from the keyboard
Reset(0)

Print "Enter some text:"
Input x

'' Read from STDIN (now from keyboard)
Open Cons For Input As #1
While EOF(1) = 0
  Input #1, x
  Print """"; x; """"
Wend
Close #1

Note: Under Windows, to specify to the program that data entry is completed
(transfer EOF), you can press CTRL+Z then press ENTER.

Differences from QB:
  * None for `Reset()`.
  * The `Reset(streamno)` usage is new to FreeBASIC.
