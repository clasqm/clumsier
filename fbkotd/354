__FB_OPTION_GOSUB__
================

Intrinsic define (macro value) set by the compiler

Syntax:
__FB_OPTION_GOSUB__

Description:
Indicates how `Gosub` and `Return` will be handled at compile time. If the
option is set (-1) then `Gosub` is allowed and `Return` is recognized as
return-from-gosub only. If the option is not set (0) then `Gosub` is not
allowed and `Return` is recognized as return-from-procedure only.

This macro value can be changed at compile time. `Option Gosub` will set the
option (enable gosub support) and `Option Nogosub` will clear the option
(disable gosub support).

`__FB_OPTION_GOSUB__` returns zero (0) if the option has not been set. Returns
non-zero (-1) if the option has been set.

Examples:

#if( __FB_OPTION_GOSUB__ <> 0 )
    '' turn off gosub support
    Option nogosub
#endif

Dialect Differences:
