WRITE
================

Outputs a comma-separated list of values to the screen

Syntax:
Write [ expressionlist ]

Parameters:

`expressionlist`
Comma-separated list of items to print

Description:

Outputs the values in `expressionlist` to the screen. The values are separated
with commas, and strings are enclosed in double quotes. Numeric values with an
absolute value of less than one are prefixed with a zero (`0`) if none is
given (e.g. `0.5`, `-0.123`). Floating-point numbers with absolute values
greater than or equal to `10^16`, or with absolute values greater than `0` and
less than `10^-5` are printed in scientific notation (e.g. `1.8e+019`,
`3e-005`)

If no expression list is given, `Write` outputs a carriage return.

Examples:

Dim i As Integer = 10
Dim d As Double = 123.456
Dim s As String = "text"

Write 123, "text", -.45600
Write
Write i, d, s

will produce the output:


    123,"text",-0.456

    10,123.456,"text"

Differences from QB:
  * QBASIC might print format floating-point values in slightly different ways.
