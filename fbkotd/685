Assignment Operators
================

Operators that assign values to operands

The assignment operators perform an assignment to the first, or left-hand
side, operand based on the value of the second, or right-hand side, operand.
Most of the assignment operators are combination operators, in that they first
perform a mathematical or bitwise operation on the two operands, then assign
the result to the left-hand side operand.

##Operator =[>] (Assignment)
Assigns the value of one operand to the other.

##Operator &= (Concatenate and Assign)
Assigns the value of a concatenation between two operands.

##Operator += (Add and Assign)
Assigns the value of an addition between two operands.

##Operator -= (Subtract and Assign)
Assigns the value of a subtraction between two operands.

##Operator *= (Multiply and Assign)
Assigns the value of a multiplication between two operands.

##Operator /= (Divide and Assign)
Assigns the value of a division between two operands.

##Operator \= (Integer Divide and Assign)
Assigns the value of an integer divide between two operands.

##Operator ^= (Exponentiate and Assign)
Assigns the value of a exponentiation between two operands.

##Operator Let (Assignment)
Assigns the value of one user defined type to another.

##Operator Let() (Assignment)
Assigns the fields of a user defined type to a list of variables.

##Operator Mod= (Modulus and Assign)
Assigns the value of a modulus between two operands.

##Operator And= (Conjunction and Assign)
Assigns the value of a bitwise conjunction between two operands.

##Operator Eqv= (Equivalence and Assign)
Assigns the value of a bitwise equivalence between two operands.

##Operator Imp= (Implication and Assign)
Assigns the value of a bitwise implication between two operands.

##Operator Or= (Inclusive Disjunction and Assign)
Assigns the value of a bitwise inclusive or between two operands.

##Operator Xor= (Exclusive Disjunction and Assign)
Assigns the value of a bitwise exclusive or between two operands.

##Operator Shl= (Shift Left and Assign)
Assigns the value of a bitwise shift left of an operand.

##Operator Shr= (Shift Right and Assign)
Assigns the value of a bitwise shift right of an operand.
