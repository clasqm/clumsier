ATN
================

Returns the arctangent of a number

Syntax:
declare function Atn ( byval number as double ) as double

Usage:
result = Atn( number )

Parameters:
`number`
A number.

Return Value:
The angle, in radians, whose tangent is `number`, in the range [-Pi/2..Pi/2].

Description:
`Atn` returns the arctangent of the argument `number` as a `Double` within the
range of -Pi/2 to Pi/2. The arctangent is the inverse of the `Tan` function.
The returned angle is measured in radians (not degrees).

`Atn` can be overloaded as operator to accept user-defined types.

Examples:

Print "Pi ="; Atn ( 1.0 ) * 4
Print Atn ( 4 / 5 )

The output would be:

    Pi = 3.141592653589793
    0.6747409422235527

Differences from QB:
