GETKEY
================

Returns the ascii code of the first key in the keyboard buffer

Syntax:
declare function Getkey ( ) as long

Usage:
result = Getkey

`
Return Value:
The value of the ascii code returned.

Description:

It returns the ascii code of the first key in the keyboard buffer. The key is
removed from the buffer. If no key is present, `Getkey` waits for it.
For extended keys (returning two characters), the extended code is returned in
the first byte, and the regular code is returned in the second byte (the third
and fourth bytes always being null at least in console mode).
WARNING: In graphics mode and depending on the key pressed, ` Getkey  ` may
not always return the exact same value as in console mode (for a non-extended
key, the most significant bit of the ascii code byte may be propagated to the
higher 3 bytes of the return value, such as a sign bit).
For a compatible code of the 2 screen modes, see the example below.

The key read is not echoed to the screen.

For a keyword not stopping the program if no key is at the buffer see `Inkey`
or `Multikey`.

Examples:

Dim As Long foo
Do
    foo = GetKey
    Print "total return: " & foo
   
    If( foo > 255 ) Then
        Print "extended code: " & (foo And &hff)
        Print "regular code: " & (foo Shr 8)
    Else
        Print "regular code: " & (foo And &hff)
    End If
    Print
Loop Until foo = 27
