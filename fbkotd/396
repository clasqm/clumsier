CPTR
================

Converts a pointer expression to a specified data type pointer

Syntax:
Cptr( PointerDataType, expression )

Description:
Converts `expression` to `PointerDataType`.

`PointerDataType` must be a `Pointer` type (e.g. a DataType `Ptr` or an `Any`
`Ptr`), or a `Type (Alias)` to one.
`expression` may have a different pointer type or be an `Integer`.

  * Note: Currently, FB does not actually enforce that `PointerDataType`
  must be a pointer. This will likely change in future versions though.
  Currently, it may display a warning if you try to convert to a non-pointer
  (for any conversion type if you compile with the `-w pedantic` compiler
  switch).

Examples:

Dim intval As Integer
Dim intptr As Integer Ptr
intval = &h0080
intptr = @intval
'' will print -128 and 128, as the first expression will be "seen" as an
signed byte
Print *CPtr( Byte Ptr, intptr ), *intptr

Dialect Differences:
Not available in the -lang qb dialect unless referenced with the
alias `__Cptr`.

Differences from QB:
