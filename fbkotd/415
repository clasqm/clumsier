KILL
================

Deletes a file from disk / storage media.

Syntax:
declare function Kill ( byref filename as const string ) as long

Usage:
result = Kill( filename )

Parameters:

`filename`
The filename is the name of the disk file to delete. If the file is not in the
current directory, the path must also be given as `path/file`.

Return Value:
Returns zero (`0`) on success, or non-zero on error.

Description:

`Kill` deletes a file from disk / storage media.

The error code returned by `Kill` can be checked using `Err` in the next line.
The function version of `Kill` returns directly the error code as a 32 bit
`Long`.

Examples:

Dim filename As String = "file.ext"
Dim result As Integer = Kill( filename )
If result <> 0 Then Print "error trying to kill " ; filename ; " !"

Platform Differences:

On some platforms, `Kill` may be able to remove folders and read-only files.
Whether it succeeds or fails here is not currently defined. It may be
necessary to check the attributes of the file you are deleting, and decide
accordingly whether you want to try `Kill`ing it.

Differences from QB:
  * KILL can optionally be used as function in FreeBASIC.
