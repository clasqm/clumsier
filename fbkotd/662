WINPUT()
================

Reads a number of wide-characters from console or file

Syntax:
declare function Winput( byval num as integer ) as wstring
declare function Winput( byval num as integer, byval filenum as long = 0 ) as
wstring

Usage:
result = Winput( num [, [#]filenum } )

Parameters:

`num`
Number of characters to read.

`filenum`
File number of bound file or device.

Return Value:
Returns a Wstring of the characters read.

Description:

Reads a number of wide-characters from the console, or a bound file/device
specified by `filenum`.

The first version waits for and reads `n` wide characters from the keyboard
buffer. Extended keys are not read. The characters are not echoed to the
screen.

The second version waits for and reads `n` wide characters from a file or
device. The file position is updated.

  * Note: FreeBASIC does not currently support reading wide-characters 
  from the console.

Examples:

Dim char As WString * 2

Dim filename As String, enc As String
Dim f As Integer

Line Input "Please enter a file name: ", filename
Line Input "Please enter an encoding type (optional): ", enc
If enc = "" Then enc = "ascii"

f = FreeFile
If Open(filename For Input Encoding enc As #f) = 0 Then
   
    Print "Press space to read a character from the file, or escape to exit."
   
    Do
       
        Select Case Input(1)
       
        Case " " 'Space
           
            If EOF(f) Then
               
                Print "You have reached the end of the file."
                Exit Do
               
            End If
           
            char = WInput(1, f)
            Print char & " (char no " & Asc(char) & ")"
           
        Case Chr(27) 'Escape
           
            Exit Do
           
        End Select
       
    Loop
   
    Close #f
   
Else
   
    Print "There was an error opening the file."
   
End If
