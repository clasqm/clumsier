Compiler Option: -g
================

Add debug information, define `__FB_DEBUG__`, and enable asserts

Syntax:
-g

Description:
The `-g` compiler option inserts debugging symbols into output files, to use
with GDB-compatible debuggers.

The intrinsic macro `__FB_DEBUG__` is set to non-zero (-1) if the option was
specified, and set to zero (0) otherwise.

`Assert` and `AssertWarn` macros are enabled.

Use of `-g` automatically implies `-edebug`, `-edebuginfo`, and `-eassert`,
command line options.

`__FB_ERR__` can be used to determine in user source code if the `-g` option
was specified or implied on the command line.
