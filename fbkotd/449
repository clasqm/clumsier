WCHR
================

Returns a wide-character string containing one or more Unicode characters

Syntax:
declare function Wchr ( byval ch as integer [, ... ] ) as wstring

Usage:
result = Wchr( ch0 [, ch1 ... chN ] )

Parameters:

`ch`
The Unicode integer value of a character.

Return Value:
Returns a wide-character string.

Description:

`Wchr` returns a wide-character string containing the character(s) represented
by the Unicode values passed to it.

When `Wchr` is used with numerical constants or literals, the result is
evaluated at compile-time, so it can be used in variable initializers.

Not all Unicode characters can be displayed on any machine, the characters
available depend on the font presently in use in the console. Graphics modes
can't display Unicode characters, as the GfxLib built-in font is not Unicode.

Examples:

Print "The character represented by the UNICODE code of 934 is: "; WChr(934)
Print "Multiple UNICODE characters: "; WChr(933, 934, 935)

will produce the output:

The character represented by the UNICODE code of 934 is: Φ
Multiple UNICODE characters: ΥΦΧ



Platform Differences:

  * DOS does not support `Wchr`.

Dialect Differences:
Not available in the -lang qb dialect unless referenced with the
alias `__Wchr`.

Differences from QB:
New to FreeBASIC
