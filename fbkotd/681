Standard Data Types
================

Built-in data types

Integer types
Types that store integer values, whose range is determined by the size of the
data type and its signedness.

Floating-point types
Types that store real number values, whose range and precision is determined
by the size of the data type.

Boolean types
Types that store boolean values.

Procedure Types
Types that store pointers to procedures

Data Type Modifiers
Specifies additional characteristics of a standard or user-defined data type.

String types
Types that store or point to an array of characters.

Class types
Types that provide special capabilities to be used directly or to be extended
by user-defined types


Integer types

##BYTE and UBYTE
8-bit wide data types that store integer values.

##SHORT and USHORT
16-bit wide data types that store integer values.

##LONG and ULONG
32-bit wide data types that store integer values.

##INTEGER and UINTEGER
32-bit or 64-bit wide data types that store integer values.

##LONGINT and ULONGINT
64-bit wide data types that store integer values.

Floating-point types

##SINGLE
32-bit wide data types that store real number values.

##DOUBLE
64-bit wide data types that store real number values.

Boolean types

##BOOLEAN
1-bit wide data types that store boolean values.

Procedure Types

##FUNCTION Pointer
Types that store a pointer to a function procedure

##SUB Pointer
Types that store a pointer to a sub procedure

Data Type Modifiers

##CONST
Specifies a read only type.

##POINTER and PTR (Shortcut for 'POINTER')
Modifies types to be pointer types.

##UNSIGNED
Specifies an unsigned integer type.

##ALIAS (Modifier)
Modifies how a datatype is linked with other languages (Name mangling).

String types

##STRING
Fixed-length and variable-length strings with built-in memory management.

##ZSTRING
Fixed-length and variable-length null-terminated strings.

##WSTRING
Fixed-length and variable-length null-terminated strings of wide characters.

Class types

##OBJECT
Super class providing run-time type information
