Operator # (Preprocessor Stringize)
================

Preprocessor operator to convert macro arguments to strings

Syntax:
#macro_argument

Description:
This operator converts the `macro_argument` into a string whose value is the
name of the argument. This substitution is made during the macro expansion,
previous to compilation.

* Note: because of this feature, care should be taken when using file-handling
statements in a macro. Because of potential ambiguity with file-handling
statements that take a "`#filenum`" parameter, if `filenum` is one of the
macro parameters, it may be necessary to wrap the `filenum` expression in
parenthesis (e.g. "`#(filenum)`"), to separate it from the `#` sign.
Otherwise, `filenum` will be stringized in the macro.

Examples:

#define SEE(x) Print #x ;" = "; x
Dim variable As Integer, another_one As Integer
variable=1
another_one=2
SEE(variable)
SEE(another_one)

Output:

    variable = 1
    another_one = 2
