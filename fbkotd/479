PMAP
================

Maps coordinates between view and physical mapping.

Syntax:
declare function PMap ( byval coord as single, byval func as long ) as single

Usage:
result = PMap( coord, func )

Parameters:

`coord`
An expression indicating the coordinate to be mapped.

`func`
The mapping function number to be applied to given coordinate.

Return Value:
The mapped coordinate value.

Description:

This function converts a coordinate between view (as defined by the `Window`
statement) and physical (as set by the `View (Graphics)` statement) mappings.
Depending on the value of `func`, `expr` is used to compute a different
mapping to be returned by `PMap`:

func value: return value:
0 Treats expr as x view coordinate and returns corresponding x physical
coordinate.
1 Treats expr as y view coordinate and returns corresponding y physical
coordinate.
2 Treats expr as x physical coordinate and returns corresponding x view
coordinate.
3 Treats expr as y physical coordinate and returns corresponding y view
coordinate.


Examples:

ScreenRes 640, 480
Window Screen (0, 0)-(100, 100)
Print "Logical x=50, Physical x="; PMap(50, 0)   '' 320
Print "Logical y=50, Physical y="; PMap(50, 1)   '' 240
Print "Physical x=160, Logical x="; PMap(160, 2) '' 25
Print "Physical y=60, Logical y="; PMap(60, 3)   '' 12.5
