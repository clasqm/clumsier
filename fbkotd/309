UNLOCK
================

Removes a previous access restriction (lock) on a file

Syntax:
Unlock #filenum, record
Unlock #filenum, start To end

Parameters:
`filenum`
The file number used to `Open` the file.

`record`
The record (`Random` files) to unlock.

`start`
The first byte position (`Binary` files) in a range to unlock.

`end`
The last byte position (`Binary` files) in a range to unlock.

Description:
`Unlock` removes the temporary access restriction set by `Lock`.

It is strongly recommended to use the same arguments used in the previous
`Lock`.

Note: This command does not always work, neither as documented nor as
expected. It appears to be broken at the moment.

Examples:

For an example see `Lock`.

Differences from QB:
  * Currently, FB cannot implicitly unlock the entire file
  * In `Random` mode, FB cannot unlock a range of records
