CVSHORT
================

Converts a two-byte string to a `Short` integer variable

Syntax:
declare function Cvshort ( byref str as const string ) as Short

Usage:
result = Cvshort( str )

Parameters:

`str`
A `String` at least two bytes in length with a binary copy of a `Short`
integer variable stored in it.

Return Value:
`Short` variable holding the binary copy of a `Short`.

Description:

Returns a 16-bit `Short` integer value using the binary data contained in a
`string` of at least two bytes in length. A value of zero (`0`) is returned if
the string is less than two bytes in length.

`Cvshort` is used to convert 2-byte strings created with `Mkshort`.

This function can also be used to convert 16-bit integer values from a memory
or file buffer without the need for a `Type` structure. However, just as with
the type structure, special care should be taken when using `Cvshort` to
convert strings that have been read from a buffer.

Examples:

Dim si As Short, s As String
s = "AB"
si = CVShort(s)
Print Using "s = ""&"""; s
Print Using "si = _&H&"; Hex(si)


Dialect Differences:
Not available in the -lang qb dialect unless referenced with the
alias `__Cvshort`.

Differences from QB:
  * In QB this function is called CVI
