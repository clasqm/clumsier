declare sub Windowtitle ( byref title as const string )

Usage:
WindowTitle title

Parameters:

`title`
the string to be assigned as new window title.

Description:

This statement is useful to change the program window title. The new title set
will become active immediately if the program already runs in windowed mode,
otherwise will become the new title for any window produced by subsequent
calls to the `Screen (Graphics)` or `ScreenRes` statement. If this function is
not called before setting a new windowed mode via `Screen (Graphics)` or
`ScreenRes`, the program window will use the executable file name (without the
extension) as title by default.
This command has no effect in consoles.
