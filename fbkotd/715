__FB_UNIQUEID_PUSH__
================

Intrinsic define (macro) performed by the compiler.

Syntax:
__FB_UNIQUEID_PUSH__( stack-id )

Parameters:

`stack-id`

the name of the stack to push

Description:

Pushes a new unique identifier on to a stack identified by `stack-id` (the
size of the stack is increased by 1).
(`__FB_UNIQUEID__` allows to get the identifier at the top of the stack, and
`__FB_UNIQUEID_POP__` allows to pop an identifier off of the stack)

Note:

- The "stack-id" name itself is a separate namespace from all other symbols.
- The stack can only contain "unique identifiers".
- "unique identifier" is a name of an fb symbol that is unique to the module, 
so does not conflict or shadow other symbol names ("unique identifier" will 
have the form "LT_xxxx" as a name so it might not be completely unique).
- fb uses the form "LT_xxxx" internally for labels, symbols, temp variables, 
etc (so should avoid naming fbc symbols of this form for any fbc program 
since version 0.0).

When such a stack is no longer in use, it is recommended that it be empty (at
the end there must have been applied as many `__FB_UNIQUEID_POP__` as
`__FB_UNIQUEID_PUSH__` for this stack).
At any time of its use, the number of `__FB_UNIQUEID_POP__` applied from the
beginning must always be less than or equal to the number of
`__FB_UNIQUEID_PUSH__` applied.

Examples:

See also `__FB_UNIQUEID__` example.

' As the "unique identifiers" (used as jump labels) are successively pushed on
to a stack,
' the jump-code bodies must be defined in the reversed order than the jump
calls.
