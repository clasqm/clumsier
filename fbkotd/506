CHAIN
================

Temporarily transfers control to an external program

Syntax:
declare function Chain ( byref program as const string ) as long

Usage:
result = Chain( program )

Parameters:

`program`
The file name (including file path) of the program (executable) to transfer
control to.

Return Value:
Returns the external program's exit code if executed successfully, or negative
one (-1) otherwise.

Description:

Transfers control over to an external program. When the program exits,
execution resumes immediately after the call to `Chain`.

Examples:

#ifdef __FB_LINUX__
    Dim As String program = "./program"
#else
    Dim As String program = "program.exe"
#endif

Print "Running " & program & "..."
If (Chain(program) <> 0) Then
    Print program & " not found!"
End If

Platform Differences:

  * Linux requires the `program` name case matches the real name of the 
  file. Windows and DOS are case insensitive. The program chained may be 
  case sensitive for its command line parameters.
  * Path separators in Linux are forward slashes / . Windows uses backward
  slashes \ but it allows for forward slashes . DOS uses backward \ slashes.
  * Exit code is limited to 8 bits in DOS.

Differences from QB:
  * `Common` does not allow to keep the values of certain variables when 
  chaining programs with `Chain`.
