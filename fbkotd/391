CONST
================

Non-modifiable variable declaration.

Syntax:
Const symbolname1 [AS DataType] = value1 [, symbolname2 [AS DataType] =
value2, ...]

or

Const [AS DataType] symbolname1 = value1 [, symbolname2 = value2, ...]

Description:
Declares non-modifiable constant data that can be integer or decimal
(floating-point) numbers or strings. The constant type will be inferred if
`DataType` isn't explicitly given.

Specifying `String * size`, `Zstring * size` or `Wstring * size` as `DataType`
is not allowed.
Specifying `String` as `DataType` is tolerated but without effect because the
resulting type is always a `Zstring * size`.

Constants follow visibility rules similar to those of variables for Namespace
blocks, Type blocks, and compound block statements.

Examples:

Const Red = RGB(252, 2, 4)
Const Black As UInteger = RGB(0, 0, 0)
Const Text = "This is red text on a black bkgnd."

Locate 1, 1
Color Red, Black
Print Text
Sleep
End

Differences from QB:
  * QB does not support the `as` `datatype` syntax.
