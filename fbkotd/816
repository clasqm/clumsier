File I/O Functions
================

Statements and procedures for working with files and devices.

Description:

These statements and procedures provide file and device i/o capabilities. So
called file numbers can be bound to files or devices, which can be read or
written to using formatted (text mode) or unformatted (binary mode) data. In
binary mode, files and devices can be read from or written to in arbitrary
locations. For multithreaded applications, files and devices can also be
locked.

Opening Files or Devices

##FREEFILE
Gets an available file number that can be used to read or write from files or
devices.

##OPEN
Binds a file number to a physical file to provide reading and writing
capabilities.

##OPEN COM
Binds a file number to a communications port.

##OPEN CONS
Binds a file number to the standard input and output streams.

##OPEN ERR
Binds a file number to the standard input and error streams.

##OPEN LPT
Binds a file number to a printer device.

##OPEN PIPE
Binds a file number to the input and output streams of a process.

##OPEN SCRN
Binds a file number directly to the console.

##CLOSE
Unbinds a file number from a file or device.

##RESET
Unbinds all active file numbers.

File I/O modes

##INPUT (File Mode)
Text data can be read from the file.

##OUTPUT
Text data can be written to the file.

##APPEND
Text data is added to the end of a file when output.

##BINARY
Arbitrary data can be read from or written to the file.

##RANDOM
Blocks of data of certain size can be read from and written to the file.

File access privileges

##ACCESS
An overview of file access privileges.

##READ (File Access)
Binary data can only be read from the file.

##WRITE (File Access)
Binary data can only be written to the file.

##READ WRITE(File Access)
Binary data can be read from and written to the file.

Character encoding

##ENCODING
Specifies the character encoding of a file.

Reading from and Writing to Files or Devices

##INPUT #

##? # (Shortcut for 'PRINT #')
Writes text data to a file or device.

##PUT #
Writes arbitrary data to a file or device.

##GET #

##LOC
Gets the file position of the last read or write operation.

##EOF
Returns true if all of the data has been read from a file.

##SEEK (Statement)
