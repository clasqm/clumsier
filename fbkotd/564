PRIVATE: (Access Control)
================

Specifies private member access control in a `Type` or `Class`

Syntax:
Type typename

Private:

member declarations

End Type

Parameters:

`typename`

name of the `Type` or `Class`

`member declarations`

declarations for fields, functions, or enumerations

Description:

`Private:` indicates that `member declarations` following it have private
access. Private members are accessible only from inside a member function for
the `Type` or `Class` (so not accessible from inside a member function for
types or classes which are derived from the `Type` or `Class`).

`member declarations` following `Private:` are private until a different
access control specifier is given, like `Public:` or `Protected:`.

Members in a `Type` declaration are `Public:` by default if no member access
control specifier is given.

Examples:

Type testing
  number As Integer
  Private:
    nome As String
  Declare Sub setNome( ByRef newnome As String )
End Type

Sub testing.setnome( ByRef newnome As String )
  '' This is OK. We're inside a member function for the type
  This.nome = newnome
End Sub

Dim As testing myVariable

'' This is OK, number is public
myVariable.number = 69

'' this would generate a compile error
'' - nome is private and we're trying to access it outside any of this TYPE's
member functions
'' myVariable.nome = "FreeBASIC"
