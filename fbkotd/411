NAME
================

Renames a file on disk

Syntax:
declare function Name( byref oldname as const string, byref newname as const
string ) as long

Usage:
result = Name( oldname, newname )

Parameters:

`oldname`
Name of an existing file.

`newname`
New name of the file.

Return Value:
Returns zero (`0`) on success and non-zero on failure.

Description:

Renames a file or folder originally called `oldname` to `newname`.

The function is not guaranteed to succeed if a file/folder exists with the
same name. It may succeed, overwriting the original, or it may fail. For
greater control, `FileExists` could be used to test for an existing file, and
`Kill` could be used to delete an existing file beforehand.

Examples:

Dim OldName As String
Dim NewName As String
Dim result As Integer
OldName = "dsc001.jpg"
NewName = "landscape.jpg"
result = Name( OldName, NewName )
If 0 <> result Then
    Print "error renaming " & oldname & " to " & newname & "."
End If

Differences from QB:
  * In QB, NAME required AS rather than a comma between the old and new 
  names. This is because NAME was a language keyword rather than a function.
