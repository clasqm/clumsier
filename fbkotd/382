TAN
================

Returns the tangent of an angle

Syntax:
declare function Tan ( byval angle as double ) as double

Usage:
result = Tan( angle )

Parameters:

`angle`
the angle (in radians)

Return Value:
Returns the tangent of the argument `angle` as a `Double` within the range of
-infinity to infinity.

Description:

The argument `angle` is measured in radians (not degrees).

The value returned by this function is undefined for values of `angle` with an
absolute value of `2 ^ 63` or greater.

`Tan` can be overloaded as operator to accept user-defined types.

Examples:

Const PI As Double = 3.1415926535897932
Dim a As Double
Dim r As Double
Input "Please enter an angle in degrees: ", a
r = a * PI / 180    'Convert the degrees to Radians
Print ""
Print "The tangent of a" ; a; " degree angle is"; Tan ( r )
Sleep

The output would look like:

    Please enter an angle in degrees: 75
    The tangent of a 75 degree angle Is 3.732050807568878
