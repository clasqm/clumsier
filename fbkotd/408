SYSTEM
================

Closes all open files and ends the program

Syntax:
declare sub System ( byval retval as long = 0 )

Usage:
System( [ retval ] )

Parameters:

`retval`
Error code returned to system.

Description:

Closes all open files, exits the program, and returns to the operating system.
An optional return value, an integer, can be specified to return an error code
to the system. If no return value is given, a value of 0 is automatically
returned. This is the same as `End` and is here for compatibility between
older BASIC dialects. It is recommended to use `End` instead.

Usage of this statement does not cleanly close scope. Local variables will not
have their destructors called automatically, because FreeBASIC does not do
stack unwinding. Only the destructors of global variables will be called in
this case.

For this reason, it is discouraged to use `System` simply to mark the end of a
program; the program will come to an end automatically, and in a cleaner
fashion, when the last line of module-level code has executed.

Examples:

Print "this text is shown"
System
Print "this text will never be shown"
