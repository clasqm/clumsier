PRESERVE
================

Used with `Redim` to preserve contents will resizing an array

Syntax:
redim Preserve array(...) [as datatype]

Description:
Used with `Redim` so that when an array is resized, data is not reset but is
preserved. This means when the array is enlarged that only new data is reset,
while the old data remains the same (but not necessarily at the same absolute
addresses in memory).

NOTE: `Redim Preserve` may not work as expected in all cases:

`Preserve`'s current behavior is to keep the original data contiguous in
memory, and only expand or truncate the size of the memory (if resizing is not
possible, the whole original data block is first shifted to another memory
location).
Its behavior (with a single dimension) is well-defined only when the upper
bound is changed. If the lower bound is changed, the current result is that
the data is in effect shifted to start at the new lower bound.
If there are multiple dimensions, only the upper bound of only the first
dimension may be changed safely. If the first dimension is reduced, the
existing mappable data may be lost. If lower-order dimensions are resized at
all, the effects can be hard to predict (because multidimensional arrays are
stored in row-major order : values differing only in the last index are
contiguous).

Examples:

ReDim array(1 To 3) As Integer
Dim i As Integer

array(1) = 10
array(2) = 5
array(3) = 8

ReDim Preserve array(1 To 10)

For i = 1 To 10
    Print "array("; i; ") = "; array(i)
Next


Differences from QB:
  * `Preserve` wasn't supported until PDS 7.1
