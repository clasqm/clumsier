Option Private

Description:
`Option Private` is a statement that gives any following procedure

default remains in effect for the rest of the module in which `Option Private`
is used, and can be overridden by declaring procedures with `Public`.

'' Compile with the "-lang fblite" compiler switch

Sub ProcWithExternalLinkage()
   ' ...
End Sub
Option Private
Sub ProcWithInternalLinkage()
   ' ...
End Sub
Public Sub AnotherProcWithExternalLinkage()
   ' ...
End Sub
