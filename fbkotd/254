Compiler Option: -elocation
================

Enable full error location reporting

Syntax:
-elocation

Description:
The `-elocation` compiler option enables full location reporting in run-time
code generation.

`-elocation` is automatically implied by the `-exx` option.

`__FB_ERR__` can be used to determine in user source code if the `-elocation`
option was specified or implied on the command line.

Note: the intent of this option is for a future fbc feature to optimize out
some of the error tracking code associated with error location reporting. When
implemented, only `-exx` or `-elocation` will enable the full error location
reporting and will be optimized away otherwise.
