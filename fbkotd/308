Compiler Option: -i
================

Add a path to search for include files

Syntax:
-i < include path >

Parameters:

`include path`
The directory path, relative or absolute, of where to search for include
files.

Description:
The `-i` option allows an additional directory to be used when searching for
header files. By default, `fbc` searches in the current directory, and
prefix/inc--in that order--where, prefix is the location where FreeBASIC is
installed. A directory specified with the `-i` option will be searched before
these default directories, and when the `-i` option is used multiple times,
`fbc` will search the directories in the order they are listed on the command-
line.

To search in the subdirectory includes first for header files while compiling
the source file file.bas, type,

`fbc -i includes file.bas `
