DEFSHORT
================

Specifies a default data type for a range of variable names

Syntax:
Defshort start_letter[-end_letter ][, ...]

Parameters:

`start_letter`
the first letter in the range

`end_letter`
the last letter in the range

Description:

`Defshort` specifies that variables and arrays which aren't declared with a
data type - or not declared at all - are implicitly declared of type `Short`
if the first letter of their names matches a certain letter or lies within an
inclusive range of letters.

Examples:

This will make `sNumber` a `Short` number since its first letter starts with
`s`.

'' Compile with -lang fblite or qb
#lang "fblite"
DefShort s
Dim sNumber

Dialect Differences:
Available in the -lang fblite dialect.
  * Not available in the -lang qb dialect unless referenced with the
alias `__Defshort`.

Differences from QB:
New to FreeBASIC
  * In QBasic, to make variables default to a 2 byte integer, DEFINT is used.
