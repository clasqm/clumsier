#ASSERT
===================

Preprocessor conditional directive

Syntax:
#assert  condition

Parameters:
`condition`
A conditional expression that is assumed to be true

Description:
Asserts the truth of a conditional expression at compile time. If `condition`
is false, compilation will stop with an error.

This statement differs from the `ASSERT` macro in that `#assert` is evaluated
at compile-time and `ASSERT` is evaluated at run-time.

Examples:

Const MIN = 5, MAX = 10
#assert MAX > MIN '' cause a compile-time error if MAX <= MIN
