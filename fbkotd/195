Compiler Option: -enullptr
================

Enable null-pointer checking

Syntax:
-enullptr

Description:
The `-enullptr` compiler option enables null-pointer error checking in run-
time code generation. A run-time error is generated if an attempt is made to
dereference a null-pointer to a value, or call a null function pointer.

`-enullptr` is automatically implied by the `-exx` option.

`__FB_ERR__` can be used to determine in user source code if the `-enullptr`
option was specified or implied on the command line.
