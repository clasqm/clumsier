X11
================

The X Windowing System is widely used on Linux as the layer that coordinates
drawing to the screen by providing windows. It also delivers events such as
mouse and keyboard input from the kernel to applications. It is designed to
run as a server that can be contacted through a specific protocol. The
client's side of the protocol is implemented by libraries such as the old Xlib
or the more modern XCB. Applications can use these to create windows and draw
to them. However, typically most developers will choose to use a GUI library
such as GTK+ (which has an X11 backend) instead.
