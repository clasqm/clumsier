Compiler Option: -pp
===================

Emit the preprocessed input file only, do not compile

Syntax:
-pp

Description:

The `-pp` compiler option enables the preprocessor-only mode. The code is
parsed & checked as usual, but is not compiled. For every input file
<source>.bas passed to the compiler, a pre-processed version named
<source>.pp.bas is generated.
Specifically, preprocessor commands such as conditional compilation (#if,
#ifdef, #ifndef, etc.), text replacement (#define, #macro, etc.) and file
inclusion (#include) are processed recursively, and the resulting expanded
code is written to the pp.bas file.
