Operators
================

Procedures that operate on one or more operands.

FreeBASIC has numerous operators that perform a certain function with their
operands. Many operators use a "`operand operator operand`" syntax, like
`Operator = (Assignment)` or `Operator +`, while others are called like normal
procedures, like `Operator Strptr`.

##Assignment operators
Operators which assign the value of one operand to the other.

##Arithmetic operators
Operators that perform mathematical computations on their operands and return
the result.

##Conditional operators
Operators that compare the relationship between their operands.

##Logical operators
Operators that perform bitwise computations with their operands and return the
result.

##Short circuit operators
Operators that perform short circuit evaluations with their operands and
return the result.

##Indexing operators
Operators that return references to variables or objects based on an index
value.

##String operators
Operators overloaded to work with strings.

##Preprocessor operators
Operators that control preprocessor behavior.

##Pointer operators
Operators that work with pointers and addresses.

##Type or Class operators
Operators that provide access to Type or Class members.

##Memory operators
Operators that allocate memory for and construct objects.

##Iterating operators
Operators that use iterator objects in `For...Next` statements.
