OPTION GOSUB
================

Enables support for `Gosub` and `On Gosub`.

Syntax:
Option Gosub

Description:
`Option Gosub` enables support for `Gosub` and `Return` (from gosub).

Because `Return` could mean return-from-gosub or return-from-procedure,
`Option Gosub` and `Option Nogosub` can be used to enable and disable `Gosub`
support. When `Gosub` support is disabled, `Return` is then recognized as
return-from-procedure.

Examples:

'' Compile with the "-lang fblite" compiler switch
#lang "fblite"
'' turn on gosub support
Option GoSub
GoSub there
backagain:
    Print "backagain"
    End
there:
    Print "there"
    Return

Dialect Differences:
Only available in the -lang fblite and -lang qb dialects.

Differences from QB:
New to FreeBASIC
