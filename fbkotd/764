Preprocessor
================

Commands that control the preprocessor.

Description:

Preprocessor commands are sent to the compiler to control what gets compiled
and how. They can be used to choose to compile one block of code rather than
another for cross-platform compatibility, include headers or other source
files, define small inline functions called macros, or alter how the compiler
handles variables.

Conditional Compilation

Commands that allow for branches in compilation based on conditions.

Text Replacement

Commands that create text-replacement macros.

File Directives

Commands that indicate to the compiler how other files relate to the source
file.

Control Directives

Commands that set compile options, control compilation, and report compile
time information.

Metacommands

Commands that are kept for backward compatibility.


Conditional Compilation

###IF
Compiles the following code block based on a condition.

###IFDEF
Compiles the following code block if a symbol is defined.

###IFNDEF
Compiles the following code block if a symbol is not defined.

###ELSEIF
Compiles the following code block if a condition is true and the previous
conditions was false.

###ELSE
Compiles the following code block if previous conditions were false.

###ENDIF
Signifies the end of a code block.

##DEFINED
Returns "-1" if a symbol is defined, otherwise "0".

Text Replacement

###DEFINE
Creates a single-line text-replacement macro.

###MACRO and #ENDMACRO
Creates a multi-line text-replacement macro.

###UNDEF
Undefines a symbol.

### Preprocessor stringize
Converts text into a string literal.

#### Preprocessor concatenate
Concatenates two pieces of text.

##! Escaped String Literal
Indicates string literal immediately following must be processed for escape
sequences.

##$ Non-Escaped String Literal
Indicates string literal immediately following must not be processed for
escape sequences.

File Directives

###INCLUDE
Inserts text from a file.

###INCLIB
Includes a library in the linking processes.

###LIBPATH
Includes a path to search for libraries in the linking process.

Control Directives

###PRAGMA
Sets compiling options.

###LANG
Sets dialect from source.

###PRINT
Outputs a messages to standard output while compiling.

###ERROR
Outputs a messages to standard output and stops compilation.

###ASSERT
Stops compilation with an error message if a given condition is false.

###LINE
Sets the current line number and file name.
