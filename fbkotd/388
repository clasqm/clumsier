PASCAL
================

Specifies a Pascal-style calling convention in a procedure declaration

Syntax:

Sub name Pascal [Overload] [Alias "alias"] ( parameters )
Function name Pascal [Overload] [Alias "alias"] ( parameters ) [ Byref ] as
return_type

Description:
In procedure declarations, `Pascal` specifies that a procedure will use the
`Pascal` calling convention. In the Pascal calling convention, any parameters
are to be passed (pushed onto the stack) in the same order in which they are
listed, that is, from left to right. The procedures need not preserve the
`EAX`, `ECX` or `EDX` registers, and must clean up the stack (pop any
parameters) before it returns.

`Pascal` is not allowed to be used with variadic procedure declarations (those
with the last parameter listed as "`...`").

`Pascal` is the default calling convention for procedures in Microsoft
QuickBASIC, and is the standard convention used in the Windows 3.1 API.

Examples:

Declare Function MyFunc Pascal Alias "MyFunc" (MyParm As Integer) As Integer
