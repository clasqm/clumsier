LSET
================

Left-justifies a string

Syntax:
declare sub Lset ( byref dst as string, byref src as const string )
declare sub Lset ( byval dst as wstring ptr, byval src as const wstring ptr )

Usage:
Lset dst, src
Lset dst_udt, src_udt

Parameters:

`dst`
String `String` to receive the data.

`src`
Source `String` to get the data.

`dst_udt`
User defined `Type` to receive the data.

`src_udt`
User defined `Type` to copy the data from.

Description:

`Lset` left justifies text into the string buffer `dst`, filling the left part
of the string with `src` and the right part with spaces. The string buffer
size is not modified.
If text is too long for the string buffer size, `Lset` truncates characters
from the right.

For compatibility with QBasic, `Lset` can also copy a user defined type
variable into another one. The copy is made byte for byte, without any care
for fields or alignment. It's up to the programmer to take care for the
validity of the result.

Examples:

Dim buffer As String
buffer = Space(10)
LSet buffer, "91.5"
Print "-[" & buffer & "]-"



Type mytype1
    x As Integer
    y As Integer
End Type

Type mytype2
    z As Integer
End Type

Dim a As mytype1 , b As mytype2
b.z = 1234

LSet a, b
Print a.x


Differences from QB:
  * In QB, the syntax was `Lset dst = src`. That syntax is also supported 
  by FB.
