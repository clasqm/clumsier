2D Drawing Functions
================

Statements and procedures for working with 2D graphics.

Description:

The statements and procedures listed here provide ways of drawing to the
screen. Image buffers can be created and blitted to the screen using a variety
of blending methods. Palette colors can be retrieved or set in graphics modes
that support them.


Working with Color

##COLOR
Sets the foreground and background color to use with the drawing procedures.

##PALETTE
Gets or sets color table information in paletted modes.

##RGB
Returns a color value for hi/truecolor modes.

##RGBA
Returns a color value including alpha (transparency) for hi/truecolor modes.

##POINT
Gets a pixel value from an image buffer or screen.

Drawing to Image Buffers

##PSET and PRESET
Plots a single pixel on an image buffer or screen.

##LINE (GRAPHICS)
Plots a line of pixels on an image buffer or screen.

##CIRCLE
Plots circles and ellipses on an image buffer or screen.

##DRAW
Draws in a sequence of commands on an image buffer or screen.

##DRAW STRING
Writes text to an image buffer or screen.

##PAINT
Fills an area with color on an image buffer or screen.

Image Buffer Creation

##GET (GRAPHICS)
Creates an image buffer from a portion of another image buffer or screen.

##IMAGECREATE
Creates an image buffer of a certain size and pixel depth.

##IMAGEDESTROY
Frees an image buffer resource.

##IMAGECONVERTROW
Converts a row of pixels in an image buffer to a different color depth.

##IMAGEINFO
Retrieves useful information about an image buffer

##BLOAD
Creates an image buffer from a file.

##BSAVE
Saves an image buffer to a file.

Blitting Image Buffers
##PUT (GRAPHICS)

Blits an image buffer to another image buffer or screen.

Blending Methods

##ADD
Saturated addition of the source and target components.

##ALPHA
Blend using a uniform transparency or the image buffer's alpha channel.

##AND
Combine the source and target components using a bitwise `And`

##OR
Combine the source and target components using a bitwise `Or`

##PSET
Directly copy pixel colors from the source to the destination.

##TRANS
Pixels matching the transparent mask color are not blitted.

##CUSTOM
Allows a custom blending procedure to be used.

##XOR
Combine the source and target components using a bitwise `Xor`
