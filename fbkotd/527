Memory Functions
================

Procedures that work with static and dynamic memory.

Description:

These procedures provide access to the free store, or heap. Memory from the
free store can be reserved and freed, and procedures are provided to read and
write directly to that memory.

Working with Dynamic Memory

##ALLOCATE
Reserves a number of bytes of uninitialized memory and returns the address.

##CALLOCATE
Reserves a number of bytes of initialized (zeroed) memory and returns the
address.

##REALLOCATE
Changes the size of reserved memory.

##DEALLOCATE
Returns reserved memory back to the system.

Miscellaneous Procedures

##PEEK
Reads some type of value from an address.

##POKE
Writes some type of value to an address.

##CLEAR
Clears data in an array with a specified value.

##FB_MEMCOPY
Copies a block of memory from a location to another.
(memory areas must not overlap)

##FB_MEMCOPYCLEAR
Copies the first part of a block of memory from a location to another and
clears the rest.
(memory areas must not overlap)

##FB_MEMMOVE
Copies a block of memory from a location to another.
(memory areas may overlap)

##SWAP
Exchange the contents of two variables.

##SADD
