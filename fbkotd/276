ERROR
================

Error handling statement to force an error to be generated

Syntax:
declare sub Error ( errno as integer )

Usage:
Error number

Parameters:
`number`
The error number to generate

Description:

Error invokes the error handler specified with On Error or, in case there was
none set, aborts the program, printing an error message similar to those
generated by the compiler's -exx run-time error checking. It's possible to use
the built-in run-time error numbers and/or other custom error numbers for
number. This can be used to simulate custom error numbers.

Examples:

To send an error alert of error 150 (just some arbitrary error code) one would
do the following:

Error 150

Differences from QB:
Error numbers are not the same as in QB.
