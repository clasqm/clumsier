FIX
================

Returns the integer part of a number, rounding towards zero

Syntax:
declare function Fix ( byval number as single ) as single
declare function Fix ( byval number as double ) as double
declare function Fix ( byval number as integer ) as integer
declare function Fix ( byval number as uinteger ) as uinteger

Usage:
result = Fix( number )

Parameters:

`number`
the floating-point number to truncate

Return Value:
Returns the integer part of `number`, rounding towards zero.

Description:

Equivalent to: `Sgn(number) * Int(Abs(number))`. For example, `Fix(1.3)` will
return `1.0`, and `Fix(-4.9)` will return `-4.0`. For integer types, the
number is returned unchanged.

Note: this function is also equivalent to `number - Frac(number)`.

The `Fix` unary `operator` can be overloaded with user defined types.

Examples:

Print Fix(1.9)  '' will print  1
Print Fix(-1.9) '' will print -1

Dialect Differences:
In the -lang qb dialect, this operator cannot be overloaded.

Differences from QB:
