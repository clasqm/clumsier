DateDiff
================

Gets the difference of two dates measured by a specified interval

Syntax:
declare function DateDiff ( byref interval as const string, byval serial1 as
double, byval serial2 as double, byval firstdayofweek as long = fbUseSystem,
byval firstdayofyear as long = fbUseSystem ) as long

Usage:
#include "vbcompat.bi"
result = DateDiff( interval, date_serial1, date_serial2 [, firstdayofWeek [,
firstweekofyear ] ] )

Parameters:

`interval`
the unit of time (interval) with which to measure the difference

`date_serial1`
starting date serial

`date_serial2`
end date serial

`firstdayofweek`
first day of the week

`firstdayofyear`
first day of the year

Return Value:
Returns an integer corresponding to the number of `interval`s found between
two Date Serials.

If `date_serial1` > `date_serial2`, the result is negative.

Description:

`interval` is specified as follows:

value interval
yyyy years
q quarter(three months)
m months
w seven day periods
ww calendar weeks
d,y days
h hours
n minutes
s seconds


`first_dayofweek` Affects the counting when `'ww'` interval is used.

value first day of week constant
omitted sunday

1 sunday fbSunday
2 monday fbMonday
3 tuesday fbTuesday

6 friday fbFriday
7 saturday fbSaturday


`first_weekofyear` specifies which year (previous or next) that the week which

value first week of year constant
0 local settings fbUseSystem
1 January 1's week fbFirstJan1
2 first weeks having 4 days in the year fbFirstFourDays
3 first full week of year fbFirstFullWeek


Notice if you do an arithmetical subtraction of two date serials you get the
difference in days.

The compiler will not recognize this function unless `vbcompat.bi` or
`datetime.bi` is included.

Examples:

#include "vbcompat.bi"

Dim s As String, d1 As Double, d2 As Double

Line Input "Enter your birthday: ", s

If IsDate( s ) Then
  d1 = DateValue( s )
  d2 = Now()

  Print "You are " & DateDiff( "yyyy", d1, d2 ) & " years old."
  Print "You are " & DateDiff( "d", d1, d2 ) & " days old."
  Print "You are " & DateDiff( "s", d1, d2 ) & " seconds old."

Else
  Print "Invalid date"

End If
