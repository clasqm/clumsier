FLIP
================

Changes the current video display page

Syntax:
declare function Flip ( byval frompage as long = -1, byval topage as long = -1
) as long

Usage:
Flip [ frompage ] [, topage ]

Parameters:

`frompage`
previous page

`topage`
new page to display

Return Value:
Returns zero (`0`) if successful, or a non-zero error code to indicate a
failure.

Description:

In normal graphics mode, `Flip` is an alias for `PCopy` and `ScreenCopy`. See
`ScreenCopy` for details.

In OpenGL mode, `Flip` does a hardware page flip and displays the contents of
the backbuffer. It is recommended that you call `Flip` regularly while in
OpenGL mode, otherwise your app may also become unresponsive.

The error code returned by `Flip` can be checked using `Err` in the next line.
The function version of `Flip` returns directly the error code as a 32 bit
`Long`.

Examples:

ScreenRes 320, 240, 32, 2    'Sets up the screen to be 320x240 in 32-bit color
with 2 video pages.
ScreenSet 1,0                'Sets the working page to 1 and the displayed
page to 0


For n As Integer = 50 To 270
    Cls
    Circle (n, 50),50 ,RGB(255,255,0) 'Draws a circle with a 50 pixel 
                                      'radius in yellow on page 1
    Flip 1,0    'Copies our circle from page 1 to page 0
    Sleep 25
Next
Print "Now wasn't that neat!"
Print "Push any key."
Flip 1,0    'Copies our text from page 1 to page 0
Sleep
