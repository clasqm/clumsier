Getting source code updates and recompiling FB
================

To download updates made available in the fbc Git repository, you can do a
pull, either using your preferred graphical Git tool, or in a terminal:

 
 
    git pull


To take a look at incoming changes before applying them, do this:
 
 
    # Update remote branches
    git fetch
 
    # Take a look
    gitk --all
 
    # Everything looks ok? Then merge the remote branch into the current 
    branch to apply the update.
    git merge origin/master


Rebuilding is, most of the time, as easy as as running "make" again. Of
course, if you used compilation options (like ENABLE_STANDALONE) for the
build, you have to specify them again this time, unless they are (still) set
in `config.mk`.
 
    make
    # or if needed:
    make ENABLE_STANDALONE=1


As a special exception, for the DOS build it is necessary to run `make clean`
before `make` to properly rebuild FB after source modules have been renamed or
deleted. The reason for this is that under DOS/DJGPP the makefile uses *.o
wildcards to link fbc and archive libfb.a etc., instead of passing the
explicit .o file names, because it has to obey the command line length
limitation. If `make clean` is not run, it may use old left-over object files
from a previous build. Luckily, we do not rename or delete source files often.
