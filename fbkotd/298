AS
================

Part of a declaration which specifies a data type, or part of the Open
statement which specifies a file handle.

Syntax:
symbolname As datatype
open ... As #filenumber
type ... As datatype

Description:
`As` is used to declare the type of variables, fields or arguments and is also
used in the `Open` statement to determine the file handle. `As` is also used
with the `Type (Alias)` syntax, similar to C's typedef statement.

Examples:

'' don't try to compile this code, the examples are unrelated
Declare Sub mySub (X As Integer, Y As Single, Z As String)
' ...
Dim X As Integer
' ...

Type myType
  X As Integer
  Y As Single
  Z As String
End Type
' ...

Type TheNewType As myType
' ...

Open "test" For Input As #1
' ...

Differences from QB:
The Type (Alias) syntax was not supported in QB.
