EXEC
================

Temporarily transfers execution to an external program

Syntax:
declare function Exec ( byref program as const string, byref arguments as
const string ) as long

Usage:
result = Exec( program, arguments )

Parameters:

`program`
The file name (including file path) of the program (executable) to transfer
control to.

`arguments`
The command-line arguments to be passed to the program.

Return Value:
The exit status of the program, or negative one (-1) if the program could not
be executed.

Description:

Transfers control over to an external program. When the program exits,
execution resumes immediately after the call to `Exec`.

Examples:

'A Windows based example but the same idea applies to Linux
Const exename = "NoSuchProgram.exe"
Const cmdline = "arg1 arg2 arg3"
Dim result As Integer
result = Exec( exename, cmdline )
If result = -1 Then
    Print "Error running "; exename
Else
    Print "Exit code:"; result
End If

Platform Differences:

  * Linux requires the program case matches the real name of the file. 
  Windows and DOS are case insensitive. The program being executed may 
  be case sensitive for its command line parameters.
  * Path separators in Linux are forward slashes / . Windows uses backward 
  slashes \ but it allows for forward slashes . DOS uses backward \ slashes.
  * Exit code is limited to 8 bits in DOS.

Dialect Differences:
Not available in the -lang qb dialect unless referenced with the
alias `__Exec`.

Differences from QB:
New to FreeBASIC
