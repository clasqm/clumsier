DYLIBLOAD
================

Loads to a Dynamic Link Library (DLL) into memory at runtime

Syntax:
declare function Dylibload ( byref filename as string ) as any Pointer

Usage:
result = Dylibload ( filename )

Parameters:

`filename`
A `string` containing the filename of the library to load.

Return Value:
The `pointer` handle of the library loaded. Zero on error

Description:

`Dylibload` is used to link at runtime libraries to your program. This
function does the link and returns a handle that must be used with
`Dylibsymbol` when calling a function in the library and with `Dylibfree` when
releasing the library.

Note: If the `filename` string (without extension) already includes a
character dot (`.`), it may be mandatory to explicitly specify the filename
extension to avoid any parser ambiguity.

Examples:

See the dynamic loading example on the Shared Libraries page.

Platform Differences:

  * Dynamic link libraries are not available in DOS, as the OS doesn't 
  support them.

Dialect Differences:
Not available in the -lang qb dialect unless referenced with the
alias `__Dylibload`.

Differences from QB:
New to FreeBASIC
