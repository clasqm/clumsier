Compiler Option: -noobjinfo
=============================

Do not read/write compile-time info from/to .o and .a files

Syntax:
-noobjinfo

Description:
The `-noobjinfo` compiler option disables the writing/reading of compile-time
library and other linking options from/to .o and .a files. This also disables
the use of fbextra.x (the supplemental linker script) for discarding the
.fbctinf sections, which is useful when using the gold linker that doesn't
support this kind of linker script.
