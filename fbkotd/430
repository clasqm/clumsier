OPTION ESCAPE
================

Specifies that string literals should be processed for C-like escape sequences
by default

Syntax:
Option Escape

Description:
`Option Escape` is a statement that causes string literals to be processed for
C-like escape sequences by default. Normally, escape sequences have no effect
in string literals unless the string is prefixed with the ! operator (Escaped
String Literal). This default remains in effect for the rest of the module in
which `Option Escape` is used, and can be overridden by prefixing string
literals with the $ operator (Non-Escaped String Literal).

See Literals in the Programmer's Guide to learn more about escape sequences.

Examples:

'' Compile with the "-lang fblite" compiler switch

#lang "fblite"

Option Escape

Print "Warning \a\t The path is:\r\n c:\\\Freebasic\\\Examples"
Print $"This string doesn't have expanded escape sequences: \r\n\t"

#include "crt.bi"

Dim As Integer a = 2, b = 3
printf("%d * %d = %d\r\n", a, b, a * b)


Dialect Differences:
Only available in the -lang fblite and -lang qb dialects.
