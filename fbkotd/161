Short Circuit Operators
========================

Operators that perform a short circuit logical evaluation.

The short circuit operators perform a evaluation on the left hand operand, and
depending on the result, may go on to evaluate the right hand side. The
evaluations take place logically, in a comparison to zero.

Operator AndAlso (Short Circuit Conjunction)
Returns the result of a short circuit conjunction of two operands.

Operator OrElse (Short Circuit Inclusive Disjunction)
Returns the result of a short circuit inclusive or of two operands.
