OPEN ERR
================

Opens both the standard input (stdin) and standard error (stderr) streams for
file operations.

Syntax:
Open Err [for mode] as [#]filenumber as long

Usage:
Open Err [for mode] as [#]filenumber

or

result = Open Err( [for mode[,]] as [#]filenumber )

Parameters:

`mode`

Ignored.

`filenumber`

An unused file number.

Return Value:
A 32 bit `Long`: a zero is returned if `Open Err()` completed successfully,
otherwise a non-zero value is returned to indicate failure.

Description:

This command opens `stdin` to read from and `stderr` to write to the console
allowing read and write operations with normal file commands.

`stderr` is an output stream different from `stdout` allowing error messages
to be redirected separately from the main console output.

The normal console commands, such as `Color` and `Locate`, do not work in this
mode, because they do not accept a file number.

The `[For Input|Output]` `mode` is allowed for compatibility, but is ignored.

The error code returned by `Open Err` can be checked using `Err` in the next
line. The function version of `Open Err` returns directly the error code as a
32 bit `Long`.

Runtime errors:

`Open Err` throws one of the following runtime errors:

(`1`) Illegal function call

  * `Filenumber` was not free at the time. use `Freefile` to ensure 
  that `filenumber` is free.

Examples:

Dim a As String
Open Err For Input  As #1
Print #1,"Please write something and press ENTER"
Line Input #1, a
Print #1, "You wrote"; a
Close
Sleep
