SCREENLIST
================

Finds available fullscreen video modes

Syntax:
declare function Screenlist ( byval depth as long = 0 ) as long

Usage:
result = Screenlist( [ depth ] )

Parameters:
`depth`

the color depth for which the list of modes is requested (supported depths are
`8`, `15`, `16`, `24` and `32`)

Return Value:
returns `0`, when there are no more resolutions to read.

Description:

It works like the `Dir` function: the first call to the function requires the
`depth` parameter to be specified, it returns the lowest supported resolution
for the requested depth. Further calls to `Screenlist` without arguments
returns the next resolutions. When no more resolutions are available,
`Screenlist` returns `0`.

The result of `Screenlist` is encoded as a 32 bit value, with the screen width
as the high word and the height as the low word.

Resolutions are returned from lowest to highest supported ones.

It is safe to call this function before any graphics mode has been set.

Print "Resolutions supported at 8 bits per pixel:"

mode = ScreenList(8)
While (mode <> 0)
    w = HiWord(mode)
    h = LoWord(mode)
    Print w & "x" & h
    mode = ScreenList()
