MID (STATEMENT)
================

Overwrites a substring of a string with another

Syntax:
declare sub Mid ( byref text as string, byval start as integer, byval length
as integer, byref expression as const string )
declare sub Mid ( byval text as wstring ptr, byval start as integer, byval
length as integer, byval expression as const wstring ptr )

Usage:
Mid( text, start ) = expression

or

Mid( text, start, length ) = expression

Parameters:

`text`
The string to work with.

`start`
The start position in `text` of the substring to overwrite. The first
character starts at position 1.

`length`
The number of characters to overwrite.

Description:

Copies a maximum of `length` characters of `expression` into `text`, starting
at `start`.

If `length` is not specified, all of `expression` is copied. The size of the
string `text` is unchanged; if `expression` is too big, as much of it is
copied up to the end of `text`.

`Mid` can also be used as a function to return part of another string. See Mid
(Function).

Examples:

Dim text As String

text = "abc 123"
Print text 'displays "abc 123"

' replace part of text with another string
Mid(text, 5, 3) = "456"
Print text 'displays "abc 456"
