INSTRREV
================

Locates the last occurrence of a substring or character within a string

Syntax:
declare function Instrrev ( byref str as const string, [ Any ] byref substring
as const string, byval start as integer = -1 ) as integer
declare function Instrrev ( byref str as const wstring, [ Any ] byref
substring as const wstring, byval start as integer = -1 ) as integer

Usage:
last = Instrrev( str, [ Any ] substring [, start ] )

Parameters:

`str`
The string to be searched.

`substring`
The substring to find.

`start`
The position in `str` at which the search will begin. The first character
starts at position 1.

Return Value:
The position of the last occurrence of `substring` in `str`.

Description:

Locates the position of the last occurrence of a substring or character within
a string. If `start` parameter is not given or is less than zero, the search
begins at the last character.

Zero (0) is returned if:

  * `substring` is not found, or
  * either `str` or `substring` is an empty strings, or
  * `start` is zero, or
  * start is greater than the length of `str`.

If the `Any` keyword is specified, `Instrrev` returns the last occurrence of
any character in `substring`.

Examples:

' It will return 4
Print INSTRREV("abcdefg", "de")

' It will return 0
Print INSTRREV("abcdefg", "h")


Dim test As String
Dim idx As Integer

test = "abababab"
idx = instrrev(test, "b")

Do While idx > 0 'if not found loop will be skipped
    Print """b"" at " & idx
    idx = instrrev(Test, "b", idx - 1)
Loop



'A Unicode example:
dim text as wstring*20
text = "Привет, мир!"
print instrrev(text,"ет") ' displays 5



Platform Differences:

  * The wide-character string version of `Instrrev` is not supported for 
  DOS target.

Dialect Differences:
Not available in the -lang qb dialect unless referenced with the
