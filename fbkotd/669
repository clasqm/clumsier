Operator - (Subtract)
================

Subtracts two expressions

Syntax:
declare operator - ( byref lhs as integer, byref rhs as integer ) as integer
declare operator - ( byref lhs as uinteger, byref rhs as uinteger ) as
uinteger

declare operator - ( byref lhs as single, byref rhs as single ) as single
declare operator - ( byref lhs as double, byref rhs as double ) as double

declare operator - ( byref lhs as T Pointer, byref rhs as T Pointer ) as
integer
declare operator - ( byref lhs as T Pointer, byref rhs as integer ) as T
Pointer

declare operator - ( byref lhs as T, byref rhs as T ) as integer
declare operator - ( byref lhs as T, byref rhs as integer ) as T
declare operator - ( byref lhs as integer, byref rhs as T ) as T

Usage:
result = lhs `-` rhs

Parameters:

`lhs`
The left-hand side expression to subtract from.

`rhs`
The right-hand side expression to subtract.

`T`
Any pointer type.

Return Value:
Returns the subtraction of two expressions.

Description:

When the left and right-hand side expressions are numeric values, `Operator -`
(Subtract) returns the subtraction of the two values.

If the left and right-hand side expressions are both of the `T Pointer` type,
for some type `T`, the operator performs pointer subtraction on the address,
returning the result. This is different from numeric subtraction because the
difference is divided by `Sizeof( T )`.

If an integral value `n` is subtracted from a `T Pointer` type, the operator
performs pointer arithmetic on the address, returning the memory position of a
`T` value, `n` indices before (assuming `(-n)` is within bounds of a
contiguous array of `T` values). This behaves differently from numeric
subtraction, because the `Integer` value is scaled by `Sizeof( T )`.

Neither operand is modified in any way.

This operator can be overloaded to accept user-defined types.

Examples:

Dim n As Single
n = 4 \- 5
Print n

will produce the output:


 
 
    -1


Dialect Differences:
In the -lang qb dialect, this operator cannot be overloaded.

Differences from QB:
  * None
