LOCK
================

Restricts read/write access to a file or portion of a file

Syntax:
Lock #filenum, record
Lock #filenum, start To end

Parameters:

`filenum`

The file number used to `Open` the file.

`record`
The record (`Random` files) to lock.

`start`
The first byte position (`Binary` files) to lock from.

`end`
The last byte position (`Binary` files) to lock to.

Description:

`Lock` temporarily restricts access by other threads or programs to a file, or
portion of a file, usually to allow safe writing to it.

After modifying the data, an `Unlock` with the same parameters as the `Lock`
should be issued.

Note: This command does not always work, neither as documented nor as
expected. It appears to be broken at the moment.

Examples:

'' e.g. locking a file, reading 100 bytes, and unlocking it.
'' To run, make sure there exists a file called 'file.ext'
'' in the current directory that is at least 100 bytes.

Dim array(1 To 100) As Integer
Dim f As Integer, i As Integer
f = FreeFile
Open "file.ext" For Binary As #f
Lock #f, 1 To 100
For i = 1 To 100
    Get #f, i, array(i)
Next
Unlock #f, 1 To 100
Close #f


Differences from QB:
  * Currently, FB cannot implicitly lock the entire file
  * In `Random` mode, FB cannot lock a range of records
