Operator () (Array index)
================

Returns a reference to an element in an array

Syntax:
declare operator () ( lhs() as T, byref rhs as integer, ... ) byref as T

Usage:
result = lhs ( rhs [, ...] )

or

lhs ( rhs [, ...] ) = value

Parameters:

`lhs`
An array.

`rhs`
An index of an element in the array.

`T`
Any data type.


Description:

This operator returns a reference to an element in an array. For
multidimensional arrays, multiple indexes must be specified (up to the total
number of dimensions of the array).

For any dimension `d` in array `a`, any index less than `Lbound(a, d)` or
greater than `Ubound(a, d)` will result in a runtime error.

Examples:

Dim array(0 To 4) As Integer = { 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 }  
For index As Integer = 0 To 4
    Print array(index);
Next
Print

will produce the output:

     0 1 2 3 4
