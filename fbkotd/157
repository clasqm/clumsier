Compiler Option: -dylib
========================

Create a DLL and import library

Syntax:
-dylib

Description:
The `-dylib` compiler option creates a dynamic link library. This creates a
DLL under Windows (including the import library), and creates a .so under
Linux.

The intrinsic macro `__FB_OUT_DLL__` is set to non-zero (-1) if the `-dll`
option was specified, and set to zero (0) otherwise.

Platform Differences:
  * Not supported on the DOS platform.
