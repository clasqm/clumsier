File contexts
================

Because #includes can occur in the middle of input files, the lexer needs to
push file contexts to a stack. File input buffer, macro expansion buffer and
the token queue form a so-called "context". It is file specific and thus it
must be pushed onto a stack, so that the lexer can return to the parent (after
parsing an #include), without losing any tokens or macro text. Note that
macros can contain #includes too.

`fb.bas:fbIncludeFile()` basically just consists of:

`lexPush()`
`cProgram()`
`lexPop()`
