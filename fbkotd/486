WAIT
================

Reads from a hardware port with a mask.

Syntax:
declare function Wait ( byval port as ushort, byval and_mask as long, byval
xor_mask as long = 0 ) as long

Usage:
Wait port, and_value [, xor_value]

Parameters:

`port`
Port to read.

`and_mask`
Mask value to And the port value with.

`xor_mask`
Mask value to Xor the port value with.

Return Value:
0 if successful, -1 on failure.

Description:

`Wait` keeps reading `port` until the reading ANDed with `and_mask` and
optionally XORed with `xor_mask` gives a non-zero result.

Examples:

Wait &h3da, &h8 'Old Qbasic way of waiting for the monitor's vsync
ScreenSync 'FreeBASIC way of accomplishing the same thing


Platform Differences:

  * In the Windows and Linux versions three port numbers (&H3C7, &H3C8, 
  &H3C9) are hooked by the graphics library when a graphics mode is in use 
  to emulate VGA palette handling as in QB. This use is deprecated; use 
  `Palette` to retrieve and set palette colors.

  * Using true port access in the Windows version requires the program to 
  install a device driver for the present session. For that reason, Windows 
  executables using hardware port access should be run with administrator 
  permits each time the computer is restarted. Further runs don't require 
  admin rights as they just use the already installed driver. The driver 
  is only 3K in size and is embedded in the executable.
