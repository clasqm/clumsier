OBJECT
================

Built-in type providing run-time type information

Syntax:
type object
    as fb_BaseVT ptr vtable_ptr
    declare constructor()
end type

Usage:

type typename extends object
end type
dim variable as object

Description:
Object is a built-in type which provides Run-Time Type Information (RTTI) for
all types derived from it using `Extends`, allowing them to be used with
`Operator Is`, and to support `Virtual` and `Abstract` methods.

Extending the built-in Object type allows to add an extra hidden vtable
pointer field at the top of the `Type`. The vtable is used to dispatch
`Virtual` and `Abstract` methods and to access information for run-time type
identification used by `Operator Is`.

Examples:

See the `Operator Is` page, the `Virtual` and `Abstract` pages.

Dialect Differences:

alias `__Object`.
