#LIBPATH
===================

Preprocessor statement to add a search path for libraries

Syntax:
#libpath "path"

Description:
Adds a library search path to the linker's list of search paths as if it had
been specified on the command line with the '-p' option.

Paths are relative to the working directory where fbc was invoked and not
relative to the directory of the source file.

No error is generated if the path does not exist and compilation and linking
will continue.

Examples:

' search the lib directory for external libraries
#libpath "lib"
