REM
================

Indicates comments in the source code.

Syntax:

Rem comment

' Comment

/' Multi-line
comment '/

Description:
A source code line beginning with `Rem` indicates that the line is a comment
and will not be compiled.

The single quote character (') may also be used to indicate a comment and may
appear after other keywords on a source line.

Multi-line comments are marked with the tokens `/'` and `'/`. All text between
the two markers is considered comment text and is not compiled.

Examples:

/' this is a multi line
comment As a header of
This example '/

Rem This Is a Single Line comment

' this is a single line comment

? "Hello" : Rem comment following a statement

Dim a As Integer ' comment following a statement

? "FreeBASIC" : ' also acceptable

Dim b As /' can comment in here also '/    Integer

#if 0
    This way of commenting Out code was
    required before version 0.16
#endif

Differences from QB:
  * `Rem` may also appear after other keywords on a source line in FreeBASIC
  * Multiline comments are new to FreeBASIC
