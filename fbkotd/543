Threading Support Functions
================

Procedures for working with multithreaded applications.

Description:

These procedures allow for multithreaded programming. Threads and conditional
variables can be created and destroyed, and so-called mutexes can be obtained
to protect thread-sensitive data.


##THREADCALL
Starts a procedure with parameters in a separate thread of execution.

##THREADCREATE
Starts a procedure in a separate thread of execution.

##THREADWAIT
Waits for a thread to finish and releases the thread handle.

##THREADDETACH
Releases a thread handle without waiting for the thread to finish.

##THREADSELF
Returns the thread handle of the current thread.

##MUTEXCREATE
Creates a mutex.

##MUTEXLOCK
Acquires a lock on a mutex.

##MUTEXUNLOCK
Releases a lock on a mutex.

##MUTEXDESTROY
Destroys a mutex that is no longer needed.

##CONDCREATE
Creates a conditional variable.

##CONDWAIT
Pauses execution of a threaded procedure.

##CONDSIGNAL
Resumes execution of a threaded procedure waiting for a conditional.

##CONDBROADCAST
Resumes all threaded procedures waiting for a conditional.

##CONDDESTROY
Destroys a conditional variable that is no longer needed.


Platform Differences:

  * These procedures are not supported in DOS.
