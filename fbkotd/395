MKSHORT
================

Does a binary copy from a `short` variable to a `string`, setting its length
to 2 bytes

Syntax:
declare function Mkshort ( byval number as short ) as string

Usage:
result = Mkshort[$](number)

Parameters:

`number`
A `short` variable to binary copy to a `string`.

Return Value:
Returns a `string` with a binary copy of the `short`.

Description:

Does a binary copy from a SHORT variable to a string, setting its length to 2
bytes. The resulting string can be read back to a `short` by `Cvshort`

This function is useful to write numeric values to buffers without using a
`Type` definition.

Examples:

Dim a As Short, b As String
a = 4534
b = MKShort(a)
Print a, CVShort(b)
Sleep

Dialect Differences:
Not available in the -lang qb dialect unless referenced with the
alias `__Mkshort`.
  * The string type suffix "$" is optional in the -lang fblite dialect.
  * The string type suffix "$" is ignored in the -lang fb dialect, warn
  only with the -w suffix compile option (or -w pedantic compile option).

Differences from QB:
  * In QBasic this function is called `Mki`.
