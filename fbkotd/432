ACOS
================

Finds the arccosine of an angle

Syntax:
declare function Acos ( byval number as double ) as double

Usage:
result = Acos( number )

Parameters:

`number`
A cosine value in the range [-1..1].

Return Value:
The arccosine of `number`, in radians, in the range [0..Pi].

Description:

`Acos` returns the arccosine of the argument `number` as a `Double` within the
range of 0 to Pi. The arccosine is the inverse of the `Cos` function. The
returned angle is measured in radians (not degrees).

`Acos` can be overloaded as operator to accept user-defined types.

Examples:

Dim h As Double
Dim a As Double
Input "Please enter the length of the hypotenuse of a triangle: ", h
Input "Please enter the length of the adjacent side of the triangle: ", a
Print ""
Print "The angle between the sides is"; Acos ( a / h )
Sleep

The output would look like:
 
    Please enter the length of the hypotenuse of a triangle: 5
    Please enter the length of the adjacent side of the triangle: 4
 
    The angle between the sides is 0.6435011087932843
