END (Block)
================

Indicates the end of a compound statement block.

Syntax:
End { Sub | Function | If | Select | Type | Enum | Scope | With | Namespace |
Extern | Constructor | Destructor | Operator | Property }

Description:
Used to indicate the end of the most recent code block.

The type of the block must be included in the command: one of `Sub`,
`Function`, `If`, `Select`, `Type`, `Enum`, `Scope`, `With`, `Namespace`,
`Extern`, `Constructor`, `Destructor`, `Operator`, or `Property`.

Ending a `Sub`, `Function`, `If`, `Select`, `Scope`, `Constructor`,
`Destructor`, `Operator`, or `Property` block also closes the scope for
variables defined inside that block. When the scope is closed, variables
defined inside the scope are destroyed, calling their destructors as needed.

To end a program, see `End (Statement)`.

Examples:

Declare Sub checkvalue( n As Integer )

Dim variable As Integer

Input "Give me a number: ", variable
If variable = 1 Then
Print "You gave me a 1"
Else
Print "You gave me a big number!"
End If
checkvalue(variable)

Sub checkvalue( n As Integer )
Print "Value is: " & n
End Sub
