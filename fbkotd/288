Escape Sequences
================

Escape sequences can be used in string literals by using the operator ! .

Usage:
result = !"text"

Description:
The accepted escape sequences in text are:
\a beep
\b backspace
\f formfeed
\l or \n newline
\r carriage return
\t tab
\unnnn unicode char in hex
\v vertical tab
\nnn ascii char in decimal
\&hnn ascii char in hex
\&onnn ascii char in octal
\&bnnnnnnnn ascii char in binary
\\\ backslash
\" double quote
\' single quote

Note: The zero-character (\000 = \&h00 = \&o000 = \&b00000000) is the null
terminator. Only characters before the first null terminator can be seen when
the literal is used as a `String`. To get a zero character in a string use
`Chr(0)` instead.
