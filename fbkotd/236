Compiler Option: -include
================

Include a header file on each source compiled

Syntax:
-include < include file >

Parameters:
`include file`
The header file name with extension, and optionally a path, to include.

Description:
The `-include` option has the effect of adding an `#include` preprocessor
directive to the very beginning of each source file before processing it. When
used multiple times, the files will be included in the order they are listed
on the command-line.

To include the file header.bi when processing file1.bas and file2.bas, type,
