================

Returns the decimal part of a number

Syntax:
declare function Frac ( byval number as double ) as double
declare function Frac ( byval number as integer ) as integer
declare function Frac ( byval number as uinteger ) as uinteger

Usage:
result = Frac( number )

Parameters:

`number`
the number or expression to get the fraction part of.

Return Value:
Returns the fractional part of a number or expression.

Description:
Equivalent to: `(number - Fix(number))`.
For example, `Frac(4.25)` will return `0.25`, and `Frac(-1.75)` will return
`-0.75`. For integer types, the value `0` is always returned.

The `Frac` unary `operator` can be overloaded with user defined types.

Examples:

Print frac(10.625)  '' will print  0.625
Print frac(-10.625) '' will print -0.625

Dialect Differences:
In the -lang qb dialect, this operator cannot be overloaded.
