NEXT
================

Control flow statement to mark the end of a `For...Next` loop.

Syntax:
Next [ identifier_list ]

Description:
Indicates the end of a statement block associated with a matching `For`
statement.

When `Next` is used on its own without an identifier_list, it closes the most
recent `For` statement block.

`identifier_list` is optional and may be one or more variable names separated
by commas. This form of the `Next` statement is retained for compatibility
with QB. `identifier_list`, if given, must match the identifiers used in the
associated `For` statements in reverse order, from inner to outer.

Examples:

For i As Integer = 1 To 10
    For j As Integer = 1 To 2
        ' ...
    Next
Next

For i As Integer = 1 To 10
    For j As Integer = 1 To 2
        ' ...
    Next j
Next i

For i As Integer = 1 To 10
For j As Integer = 1 To 2
    ' ...
Next j,i

Differences from QB:
  * `Byref` arguments cannot be used as counters.
