SCREENSET
================

Sets current work and visible pages

Syntax:
declare sub Screenset ( byval work_page as long = -1, byval visible_page as
long = -1 )

Usage:
Screenset [ work_page ] [, visible_page ]

Parameters:

`work_page`
index to working page

`visible_page`
index to visible page

Description:

`Screenset` allows to set the current working page and the current visible
page. Page numbers range from `0` to `num_pages - 1`, where `num_pages` is the
number of pages specified when setting the graphics mode with `Screenres` or
`Screen`. You can use this function to achieve page-flipping or double-
buffering.

If you provide `visible_page` but omit `work_page`, only the visible page is
changed. If you provide `work_page` but omit `visible_page`, only the work
page is changed. If you omit both arguments, both work page and visible page
are reset to page 0.

`Screenset` provides one method of writing to the screen without instantly
displaying changes to the user. See also `Screenlock` / `Screenunlock` for an
alternative method of doing this.

Note: The current cursor position is not handled independently for each video
page. Therefore, when another working page is selected, the starting cursor
position corresponds to the last cursor position on the previous working page
(same behavior for the text cursor and the graphics cursor).

Examples:

' Open graphics screen (320*200, 8bpp) with 2 pages
ScreenRes 320, 200, 8, 2

' Work on page 1 while displaying page 0
ScreenSet 1, 0

Dim As Integer x = -40

Do
    '' Clear the screen, draw a box, update x
    Cls
    Line (x, 80)-Step(39, 39), 4, BF
    x += 1: If (x > 319) Then x = -40
   
    ' Wait for vertical sync: only used to control refresh rate, can be 
    'put anywhere in the Do loop
    ScreenSync
   
    ' Copy work page to visible page
    ScreenCopy
   
Loop While Inkey = ""
