INPUT #
================

Reads a list of values from a text file

Syntax:
Input # filenum, variable_list

Parameters:

`filenum`
a file number of a file or device opened for `Input`

`variable_list`
a list of variables used to hold the values read

Description:

Reads from a text file through a bound file number a delimiter-separated set
of values and writes them in reading order into the variables in
`variable_list`. If a variable is numeric the read value is converted from its
string representation into the corresponding type.

Numeric values are converted in a similar way to the procedures `Val` and
`ValLng`, using the most appropriate function for the number format.

Delimiters may be commas or line breaks. Whitespace is also treated as a
separator after numbers. A string including a comma or a whitespace must be
surrounded by double quotes.

To read an entire line into a string, use `Line Input` instead.

Write # can be used to create a file readable with `Input #`.

Examples:

Dim a As Integer
Dim b As String
Dim c As Single

Open "myfile.txt" For Output As #1
Write #1, 1, "Hello, World", 34.5
Close #1

Open "myfile.txt" For Input As #1
Input #1, a, b, c
Close #1
Print a, b, c


Differences from QB:
  * QB has a bug in INPUT # that causes it to read past the end of the 
  line if it does not find a matching end-quote when reading a string. 
  If you are porting QB code that relies upon this bug, you may need to 
  edit your data files to remove newlines from inside quoted strings, 
  or to use a custom function to piece back together the multiline string.
