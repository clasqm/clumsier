SWAP
================

Exchanges the values of two variables

Syntax:
declare sub Swap ( byref a as any, byref b as any )

Parameters:

`a`
A variable to swap.

`b`
A variable to swap.

Description:

Swaps the value of two variables, including UDT instances (swaps all data
members).

Note: When the data are referenced by a pointer, alone or within a descriptive
structure (a UDT, for example), `Swap` only exchanges the values of the
pointers or the contents of the descriptive structures without accessing data
themselves.
For var-len strings, `Swap` only exchanges the descriptors of the strings
rather than reallocate memory for exchange all strings data characters.
For UDTs, `Swap` simply exchanges the contents of the structures, without any
operators or methods being called.

Examples:

' using swap to order 2 numbers:
Dim a As Integer, b As Integer

Input "input a number: "; a
Input "input another number: "; b
If a > b Then Swap a, b
Print "the numbers, in ascending order are:"
Print a, b

Differences from QB:
  * None
