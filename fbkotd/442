TAB
================

Sets the column when writing to screen or file

Syntax:
Tab( col_num )

Usage:
Print Tab( column ) [(, | ;)] ...

Parameters:

`column`
`1`-based column number to move to

Description:

`Tab` will move the cursor to given `column` number when `Print`ing to screen
or to a file. Character cells skipped over between the old and new cursor
positions are left unchanged.
If the current column is greater than `column`, then `Tab` will move the
cursor to the requested column number on the next line. If the current column
is equal to `column`, then the cursor will not move anywhere.

Examples:

'' Using Print with Tab to justify text in a table

Dim As String A1, B1, A2, B2

A1 = "Jane"
B1 = "Doe"
A2 = "Bob"
B2 = "Smith"

Print "FIRST NAME"; Tab(35); "LAST NAME"
Print "\----------"; Tab(35); "\----------"
Print A1; Tab(35); B1
Print A2; Tab(35); B2


The output would look like:
 
 
    FIRST NAME                         LAST NAME
    ----------                         ----------
    Jane                               Doe
    Bob                                Smith


Differences from QB:
  * In QBASIC, spaces were printed in the gap, while in FreeBASIC, the 
  characters are just skipped over and left untouched.
