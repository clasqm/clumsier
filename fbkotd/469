Operator OR= (Inclusive Disjunction and Assign)
================

Performs a bitwise-or (inclusive disjunction) and assigns the result to a
variable

Syntax:
declare operator Or= ( byref lhs as T1, byref rhs as T2 )

Usage:
lhs Or= rhs

Parameters:

`lhs`
The variable to assign to.

`T1`
Any numeric or boolean type.

`rhs`
The value to perform a bitwise-or (inclusive disjunction) with `lhs`.

`T2
Any numeric or boolean type.

Description:

This operator performs a bitwise-or and assigns the result to a variable (for
conversion of a boolean to an integer, false or true boolean value becomes 0
or -1 integer value). It is functionally equivalent to:

`lhs = lhs or rhs`

`Or=` compares each bit of its operands, `lhs` and `rhs`, and if either bits
are 1, then the corresponding bit in the first operand, `lhs`, is set to 1,
otherwise it is set to 0.

This operator can be overloaded for user-defined types as a member `Operator`
using the appropriate syntax.

Note: Similarly to the operator '=[>]' (assign), the alternative symbol 'Or=>'
can be also used.

Examples:

Dim As UByte a = &b00110011
Dim As UByte b = &b01010101
a Or= b
'' Result    a = &b01110111
Print Bin(a)


Dialect Differences:
In the -lang qb dialect, this operator cannot be overloaded.
