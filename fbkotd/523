OPTION()
================

Specifies additional attributes and/or characteristics of symbols.

Syntax:
Option( "literal-text" )

Parameters:

`literal-text`
The literal text specifying the option. See description.

Description:

`Option()` allows the programmer to specify additional attributes or
characteristics. Enclosing the string into quotes and parentheses is required
in the syntax. Unrecognized options are ignored.

`Option` can also be used as a statement to specify other compile time
options. See Compiler Switches.

Individual options are explained below.

SSE
`Option("SSE")` indicates that a floating point value (`Single` or `Double`)
returned from a function is stored in the `xmm0` register. `Option("SSE")` is
ignored unless the source is compiled with the -fpu SSE command line option.
This option may be used immediately after the return type in a function
declaration or function definition. This option is an optimization only and
not required to compile programs using the -fpu SSE command line option.

Declare Function ValueInXmm0 () As Double Option("sse")


FPU
`Option("FPU")` indicates that a floating point value (`Single` or `Double`)
returned from a function is stored in the `st(0)` register. This option may be
used immediately after the return type in a function declaration or function
definition.

Declare Function ValueInStZero () As Double Option("fpu")
