Operator / (Divide)
================

Divides two numeric expressions

Syntax:
declare operator ( byref lhs as double, byref rhs as double ) as double

Usage:
result = lhs `/` rhs

Parameters:

`lhs`
The left-hand side dividend expression.

`rhs`
The right-hand side divisor expression.

Return Value:
Returns the quotient of a dividend and divisor.

Description:

`Operator /` (Divide) returns the quotient of a dividend and divisor.

Neither operand is modified in any way. Unlike with integer division, float
division by zero is safe to perform, the quotient will hold a special value
representing infinity, converting it to a string returns something like "Inf"
or "INF", exact text is platform specific.

This operator can be overloaded to accept user-defined types.

Examples:

Dim n As Double
Print n / 5
n = 6 / 2.3
Print n
Sleep

Output:

  
    0
    2.608695652173913

Dialect Differences:
