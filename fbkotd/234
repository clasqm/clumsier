Operator ## (Preprocessor Concatenate)
================

Preprocessor operator to concatenate strings

Syntax:
text##text

Description:
This operator creates a new token by concatenating the texts at both sides of
it. This text can be recognized by other macros and further expanded. One use,
is to create a macro that expands to different macro names, variable names,
and function names depending on the arguments received.

Examples:
#define Concat(t,n) t##n
Print concat (12,34)
Dim Concat (hello,world) As Integer
Concat (hello,world)=99
Print helloworld

Output:

    1234
    99
