
Compiler Option: -s
================

Sets the executable subsystem

Syntax:
-s < subsystem >

Parameters:
`subsystem`
The executable subsystem: `gui` or `console`.

Description:
The `-s` compiler option specifies the executable subsystem. Allowed
subsystems are `gui` and `console` (by default, `console` is used). Specifying
a `gui` subsystem prevents the console window from appearing behind the
program window.

The intrinsic macro `__FB_GUI__` is set to non-zero (-1) if the option with
`gui` as subsystem was specified, and set to zero (0) otherwise.

Platform Differences:
Supported on Windows and Cygwin only.
