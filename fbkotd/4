CINT
====

	Converts a numeric or string expression to an Integer or an
	Integer<bits>

Syntax:
	declare function Cint ( byval expression as datatype ) as integer
	declare function Cint<bits> ( byval expression as datatype ) as
	integer<bits>

Type typename
	declare operator cast ( ) as integer
	declare operator cast ( ) as integer<bits>
End Type

Usage:
	result = Cint( expression )
	result = Cint( string expression )
	result = Cint( user defined type )

Parameters:
	bits
		A numeric constant expression indicating the size in bits of
		integer desired. The values allowed are 8, 16, 32 or 64.
	expression
		a numeric, string, or pointer expression to cast to a Integer value
	datatype
		any numeric, string, or pointer data type
	typename
		a user defined type

Return Value:
	An Integer or Integer<bits> containing the converted value.

Description:

If Cint is passed a numeric expression, it rounds it using using the
round-to-even method - i.e. it rounds to the closest integer value,
choosing the closest even integer if the number is equidistant from two
integers - and returns an Integer, or if a bits value is supplied, an
integer type of the given size.

The function does not check for an overflow; for example, for a 32-bit
Integer the results are undefined for values which are less than
-2 147 483 648 or larger than 2 147 483 647.

If the argument is a string expression, it is converted to numeric by
using Valint or Vallng, depending on the size of the result type.

The name "CINT" is derived from 'Convert to INTeger'.

Examples:

'Using the CINT function to convert a numeric value
'Create an INTEGER variable
Dim numeric_value As Integer
'Convert a numeric value
numeric_value = CInt(300.5)
'Print the result, should return 300, because 300 is even
numeric_value = CInt(301.5)
'Print the result, should return 302, because 301 is odd
Print numeric_value

Dialect Differences:

	In the -lang qb dialect, Cint will return a 16-bit integer, like
	in QB.

Differences from QB:

    The string argument was not allowed in QB
    The <bits> parameter was not allowed in QB
