OUT
================

Outputs a value to a hardware port.

Syntax:
declare function Out ( byval port as ushort , byval data as ubyte ) as long

Usage:
Out port,value

Parameters:

`port`
Hardware port to write to.

`data`
Data value to write.

Description:

This function sends `value` to `port` and returns immediately.

Examples:

'speakersound.bas
Sub Sound(ByVal freq As UInteger, dur As UInteger)
  Dim t As Double,f1 As Unsigned Short
    f1 = 1193181 \ freq
    Out &h61,Inp(&h61) Or 3
    Out &h43,&hb6
    Out &h42,LoByte(f1)
    Out &h42,HiByte(f1)
    t=Timer
    While ((Timer \- t) * 1000) < dur
      Sleep 0,1
    Wend
    Out &h61,Inp(&h61) And &hfc
End Sub

Platform Differences:

  * In the Windows and Linux versions three port numbers (&H3C7, &H3C8, &H3C9)
  are hooked by the graphics library when a graphics mode is in use to 
  emulate QB's VGA palette handling. This use is deprecated; use `Palette` 
  to retrieve and set palette colors.
  * Using true port access in the Windows version requires the program to 
  install a device driver for the present session. For that reason, Windows 
  executables using hardware port access should be run with administrator 
  permits each time the computer is restarted. Further runs don't require 
  admin rights as they just use the already installed driver. The driver 
  is only 3K in size and is embedded in the executable.
