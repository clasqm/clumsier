DEFBYTE
================

Specifies a default data type for a range of variable names

Syntax:
Defbyte start_letter[-end_letter ][, ...]

Parameters:

`start_letter`
the first letter in the range

`end_letter`
the last letter in the range

Description:
`Defbyte` specifies that variables and arrays which aren't declared with a
data type - or not declared at all - are implicitly declared of type `Byte` if
the first letter of their names matches a certain letter or lies within an
inclusive range of letters.

Examples:

This will make `bNumber` a `Byte` number since it's first letter starts with
b:

'' Compile with -lang fblite or qb
#lang "fblite"
DefByte b
Dim bNumber

Dialect Differences:
Available in the -lang fblite dialect.
  * Not available in the -lang qb dialect unless referenced with the
alias `__Defbyte`.

Differences from QB:
New to FreeBASIC
