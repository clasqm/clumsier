Compiler Option: -R
===================

Preserve intermediate `*.asm/*.c/*.ll` file(s) generated by compilation

Syntax:
-R

Description:
The `-R` compiler option causes the intermediate `*.asm/*.c/*.ll` file(s) that
are generated during the compile process to be preserved. Other than that,
compilation is performed as usual. Which files are generated exactly depends
on the used code generation backend and compilation target.

When compiling a Windows DLL, `-R` also preserves the intermediate `*.def`
file used for generating the import library for the DLL.
