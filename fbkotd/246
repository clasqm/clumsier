__FUNCTION_NQ__
================

Intrinsic define (macro string) set by the compiler

Syntax:
__FUNCTION_NQ__

Description:
Substituted with the non-quoted name of the current function block where used.

If `__FUNCTION_NQ__` is used at the module level, the function name given will
be `__FB_MAINPROC__` for the main module, or `__FB_MODLEVELPROC__` for a
different module. This is not the actual function name though, so it's not as
useful there.

Examples:

Sub MySub
  Print "Address of " \+ __FUNCTION__ \+ " is ";
  Print Hex( @__FUNCTION_NQ__ )
End Sub
MySub


    Address of MYSUB is 4012D0
