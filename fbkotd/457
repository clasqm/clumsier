SHELL
================

Sends a command to the system command interpreter

Syntax:
declare function Shell ( byref command as const string ) as long

Usage:
result = Shell( command )

Parameters:

`command`
A string specifying the command to send to the command interpreter.

Return Value:
If the command could not be executed, `-1` is returned. Otherwise, the command
is executed and its exit code is returned.

Description:

Program execution will be suspended until the command interpreter exits.

Examples:

'e.g. for windows:
Shell "dir c:*.*"

'e.g. for linux:
Shell "ls"


Platform Differences:

  * Linux requires the command case matches the real name of the command. 
  Windows and DOS are case insensitive. The program being shelled may be 
  case sensitive for its command line parameters.
  * Path separators in Linux are forward slashes / . Windows uses backward 
  slashes \ but it allows for forward slashes. DOS uses backward \ slashes.
  * If an empty command string is passed, DOS will open an interactive 
  command prompt. On Windows, an error may be returned.


Differences from QB:
  * QB allowed SHELL on its own without a "command" argument which caused 
  a default command shell to be started. Execution in the main program 
  would suspend until exit from the command shell. The behaviour in FB 
  is platform-dependent.
