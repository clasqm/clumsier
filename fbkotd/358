DOUBLE
================

Standard data type: 64 bit floating point

Syntax:
dim variable as Double

Description:
Double is a 64-bit, floating-point data type used to store more precise
decimal numbers. They can hold positive values in the range
`4.940656458412465e-324` to `1.797693134862316e+308`, or negative values in
the range `-4.940656458412465e-324` to `-1.797693134862316e+308`, or zero
(`0`). They contain at most 53 bits of precision, or about 15 decimal digits.

`Double`s have a greater range and precision than `Single`s, they still have
limited accuracy which can lead to significant inaccuracies if not used
properly. They are dyadic numbers - i.e. they can only accurately hold
multiples of powers of two, which will lead to inaccuracies in most base-10
fractions.
