Compiling the test suite
================

The FreeBASIC project has a suite of tests which ensure that bugs stay dead
and that new bugs have a harder time of gaining a foothold.

Compiling and getting Test Results
The tests are located in the `tests` subdirectory within the main FreeBASIC
directory. The following two commands will compile and run all the tests:

 
 
    $ make unit-tests
       generates fbc-tests[.exe]
 
    $ make log-tests
       generates failed-test-fb.log
       generates failed-test-qb.log
       generates failed-test-deprecated.log
       if all tests passed, the log file reports "None found"


Initial generation of index files will take place, followed by the compilation
of hundreds of tests. Be patient, it can take a while to run all of the
tests...

More testing options

Invoking with make will present the following help text:

 
 
    $ make
    usage: make target [options]
 
    Targets:
       unit-tests
       log-tests
       failed-tests
       check
       mostlyclean
       clean
 
    Options:
       FBC=/path/fbc
       FB_LANG=fb | fblite | qb | deprecated
       DEBUG=1
       EXTRAERR=1
       TARGET=target
       ARCH=arch (default is 486)
       OS=DOS
       FPU=fpu | sse
       FPMODE=fast | precise
       GEN=gas | gcc
       UNITTEST_RUN_ARGS=args
       ENABLE_CHECK_BUGS=1
       ENABLE_CONSOLE_OUTPUT=1
 
    Targets: Configuration and Checks
       check
 
    Example: make all available tests
       make unit-tests
       make log-tests
 
    Example: make the -lang qb tests
       make log-tests FB_LANG=qb


Reporting Test Failures

If everything is working as it should, there should be no failures. If there
is a failure, then it could indicate a problem with the compiler, or a
particular build target. If you get failures, please consider reporting on
https://www.freebasic.net/forum so others can investigate.

Thank you for running the tests and contributing to make FreeBASIC a healthy
compiler!
