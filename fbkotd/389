MKD
================

Does a binary copy from a `double` variable to a `string`, setting its length
to 8 bytes

Syntax:
declare function Mkd ( byval number as double ) as string

Usage:
result = Mkd[$]( number )

Parameters:

`number`
A `double` variable to binary copy to a `string`.

Return Value:
Returns a `string` with a binary copy of the `double`.

Description:

Does a binary copy from a `double` variable to a `string`, setting its length
to 8 bytes. The resulting string can be read back to a `double` by `Cvd`.

This function is useful to write numeric values to buffers without using a
`Type` definition.

Examples:

Dim n As Double, e As String
n = 1.2345
e = MKD(n)
Print n, CVD(e)

Dialect Differences:
The string type suffix "$" is required in the -lang qb dialect.
  * The string type suffix "$" is optional in the -lang fblite dialect.
  * The string type suffix "$" is ignored in the -lang fb dialect, warn
  only with the -w suffix compile option (or -w pedantic compile option).

Differences from QB:
  * None
