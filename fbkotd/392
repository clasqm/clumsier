INP
================

Returns a value at a hardware port.

Syntax:
declare function Inp ( byval port as ushort ) as integer

Usage:
value = Inp(port)

Parameters:

`port`
Port number to read.

Return Value:
The value at the specified port.

Description:
This function retrieves the value at 'port' and returns immediately.

Examples:

'' Turn off PC speaker
Out &h61,Inp(&h61) And &hfc


Platform Differences:

  * In the Windows and Linux versions three port numbers (&H3C7, &H3C8,
  &H3C9) are hooked by the graphics library when a graphics mode is in use
  to emulate QB's VGA palette handling. This use is deprecated; use
  `Palette` to retrieve and set palette colors.
  * Using true port access in the Windows version requires the program to
  install a device driver for the present session. For that reason, Windows
  executables using hardware port access should be run with administrator
  permits each time the computer is restarted. Further runs don't require
  admin rights as they just use the already installed driver. The driver
  is only 3K in size and is embedded in the executable.
