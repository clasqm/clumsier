(PRINT | ?) #
================

Writes a list of values to a file or device

Syntax:
(Print | ?) # filenum, [ expressionlist ] [ , | ; ]

Parameters:

`filenum`
The file number of a file or device opened for `Output` or `Append`.

`expressionlist`
List of values to write.

Description:

`Print #` outputs a list of values to a text file or device. Numeric values
are converted to their string representation, with left padding for the sign.
Objects of user-defined types must overload `Operator Cast () As String`.

Consecutive values in the expression list are separated either by a comma
(`,`) or semicolon (`;`). A comma indicates printing should take place at the
next 14 column boundary, while a semicolon indicates values are printed with
no space between them.

A new-line character is printed after the values in the expression list unless
the expression list is followed by a comma or semicolon.

Note that the comma (`,`) immediately following the file number is still
necessary, even the expression list is empty. In this case a new-line is
printed, just as with a normal expression list that doesn't have a comma or
semicolon at the end.

Examples:

Open "bleh.dat"  For Output As #1
   
    Print #1, "abc def"
    Print #1, 1234, 5678.901, "xyz zzz"
   
    Close #1


Dialect Differences:
In the -lang qb dialect, an extra space is printed after numbers.

Differences from QB:
  * None, when using QBASIC's variable types in -lang qb.
  * Unsigned numbers are printed without a space before them.
  * QB did not support casting for UDTs, so didn't allow them to be `Print`ed.
