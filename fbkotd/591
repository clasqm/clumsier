Variables
================

Symbols representing data in memory.

Description:

Variables are name symbols which can be manipulated. They are declared and
referenced using names composed of letters, numbers, and character "_". These
reference names cannot contain most other symbols because such symbols are
part of the FreeBASIC programming language. They also cannot contain spaces.
See Indentifier Rules.

In FreeBASIC, variables can be defined using the `Dim` statement.

Variables are available for later access depending on where and how the `Dim`
declaration for that variable is given. Depending on the scope of a variable,
a defined variable can be available within the main area of a program, within
a procedure, through an entire module, or through out an entire program. See
Variable Scope.

Variables are also made available when they are passed as parameters to a
procedure such as `Function` or `Sub`.

After a variable is declared with the `Dim` statement, they can be assigned,
passed to procedures, and used in expressions wherever their Standard Data
Type is similar. Sometimes variables are automatically converted to other data
types before being used in expressions, or passed as parameters to procedures.
See Coercion and Conversion.

Examples:

' compile with -lang qb or fblite

'$lang: "qb"

Declare Sub PrintConstants()

Dim FirstNumber As Integer
Dim Shared SecondNumber As Integer

FirstNumber = 1
SecondNumber = 2

PrintConstants ()
Print FirstNumber, SecondNumber, ThirdNumber 'This will print 1 2 0

Sub PrintConstants ()
    Dim ThirdNumber As Integer
    ThirdNumber = 3
    Print FirstNumber, SecondNumber, ThirdNumber 'This will print 0 2 3
End Sub
