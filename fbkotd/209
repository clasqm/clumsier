#IFDEF
===================

Preprocessor conditional directive

Syntax:

#endif

Description:
Conditionally includes statements at compile time.

Statements within the `#ifdef...#endif` block are included if `symbol` is
defined and excluded (ignored) if `symbol` is not defined.

`#ifdef symbol` is equivalent to `#if defined (symbol)`
