(PRINT | ?)
================

Writes text to the screen

Syntax:
(Print | ?) [ expressionlist ] [ , | ; ]

Parameters:

`expressionlist`
list of items to print

Description:

`Print` outputs a list of values to the screen. Numeric values are converted
to their string representation, with left padding for the sign. Objects of
user-defined types must overload `Operator Cast () As String`.

Consecutive values in the expression list are separated either by a comma
(`,`) or semicolon (`;`). A comma indicates printing should take place at the
next 14 column boundary, while a semicolon indicates values are printed with
no space between them. This has a similar effect to concatenating expressions
using `+` or `&`.

`Print` also supports the special expressions, `Spc()` and `Tab()`. These can
be used to space out expressions, or to align the printing to a specific
column.

A new-line character is printed after the values in the expression list unless
the expression list is followed by a comma or semicolon. A `Print` without any
expressions or separators following it will just print a new-line.

NOTE: `Print` resets the `Err` value after each expression is printed.

NOTE: In graphics mode, `Draw String` provides a flexible alternative to
`Print`: it prints a string to the screen with pixel positioning, transparent
background, and can use a user-supplied font.

Examples:

'' print "Hello World!", and a new-line
Print "Hello World!"

'' print several strings on one line, then print a new-line
Print "Hello";
Print "World"; "!";
Print

'' column separator
Print "Hello!", "World!"


'' printing variables/expressions
Dim As Double pi = Atn(1) * 4
Dim As String s = "FreeBASIC"

Print "3 * 4 ="; 3 * 4

Print "Pi is approximately"; pi
Print s; " is great!"


Dialect Differences:
In the -lang qb dialect, an extra space is printed after numbers.

Differences from QB:
  * None, when using QBASIC's variable types in -lang qb.
  * Unsigned numbers are printed without a space before them.
  * QB did not support casting for UDTs, so didn't allow them to be `Print`ed.
