SCREENLOCK
================

Locks the working page's frame buffer

Syntax:
declare sub Screenlock ( )

Usage:
Screenlock

Description:
All of FreeBASIC's Graphics Library functions draw to a frame buffer and an
automatic routine copies the frame buffer to the actual screen memory at each
draw. If the user program does a lot of drawing, the automatic refreshes may
take a significant amount of time.

The `Screenlock` function locks the automatic refresh, so several drawing
operations may be done before the screen refresh is performed, thus increasing
the speed of execution, and preventing the user from seeing partial results.

Frame buffer memory may be freely accessed by using pointers (see ScreenPtr)
ONLY while the screen is locked. Primitive graphics statements (`Line`,
`PSet`, `Draw String`, ...) may be used at any time.

The screen refresh remains locked until the use of `Screenunlock` statement,
which resumes it.

Calls to `Screenlock` must be paired with a matching call to `Screenunlock`.
The graphics driver keeps track of how many times `Screenlock` has been called
using a counter. Only the first call to `Screenlock` actually performs a
locking operation. Subsequent calls to `Screenlock` only increment the
counter. Conversely, `Screenunlock` only decrements the lock counter until it
reaches zero at which time the actual unlock operation will be performed.
Using `Screen` or `Screenres` will release all locks and set the lock counter
back to zero before changing screen modes.

It is strongly recommended that the lock on a page be held for as short a time
as possible. Only screen drawing should occur while the screen is locked,
input/output and waiting must be avoided. In Win32 and Linux the screen is
locked by stopping the thread that processes also the OS' events. If the
screen is kept locked for a long time the event queue could overflow and make
the system unstable. When the induced lock time becomes too long, use
preferably the method of double buffering (with `Screencopy`).

The automatic refresh takes place only in the visible page of the frame
buffer. `Screenlock` has no effect when drawing to pages other than the
visible one.

Examples:

'' Draws a circle on-screen at the mouse cursor
Dim As Integer mx, my
Dim As String key

ScreenRes 640, 480, 32

Do

  'process
  GetMouse(mx, my)
  key = Inkey()

  'draw
  ScreenLock()
  Cls()
  Circle (mx, my), 8, RGB(255, 255, 255)
  ScreenUnlock()

  'free up CPU time
  Sleep(18, 1)
 
Loop Until key = Chr(27) Or key = Chr(255, 107)


Platform Differences:

  * In DOS, the mouse arrow does not react to mouse movements while the 
  screen is locked

Dialect Differences:
Not available in the -lang qb dialect unless referenced with the
alias `__Screenlock`.

Differences from QB:
New to FreeBASIC
