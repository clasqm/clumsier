Operator ^= (Exponentiate and Assign)
================

Exponentiates and assigns a value to a variable

Syntax:
declare operator ^= ( byref lhs as double, byref rhs as double )

Usage:
lhs ^= rhs

Parameters:

`lhs`
The variable to assign to.

`rhs`
The value to exponentiate `lhs` by.

Description:

This operator exponentiates and assigns a value to a variable. It is
functionally equivalent to:

`lhs = lhs ^ rhs`

This operator can be overloaded for user-defined types as a member `Operator`
using the appropriate syntax.

Note: This operator exists in C/C++ with a different meaning - there it
performs a Bitwise `Xor=`.
Note: Similarly to the operator '=[>]' (assign), the alternative symbol '^=>'
can be also used.

Examples:

Dim n As Double
n = 6
n ^= 2
Print n
Sleep

Output:

    36

Dialect Differences:
In the -lang qb dialect, this operator cannot be overloaded.
