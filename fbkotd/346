Description:
`Mutexdestroy` discards a mutex created by `Mutexcreate`. This call should be
executed after any threads using the mutex are no longer in use.

See `Mutexcreate` for more general information on mutexes.

Dialect Differences:
Threading is not allowed in the -lang qb dialect.

Platform Differences:

  * The DOS version of FreeBASIC does not allow for threads, as the OS
  does not support them.
  * In Linux the threads are always started in the order they are created,
  this can't be assumed in Win32. It's an OS, not a FreeBASIC issue.

Differences from QB:
New to FreeBASIC
