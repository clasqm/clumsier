ASIN
================

Finds the arcsine of a number

Syntax:
declare function Asin ( byval number as double ) as double

Usage:
result = Asin( number )

Parameters:

`number`
Sine value in the range [-1..1].

Return Value:
The arcsine of `number`, in radians, in the range [-Pi/2..Pi/2].

Description:

`Asin` returns the arcsine of the argument `number` as a `Double` within the
range of -Pi/2 to Pi/2. The arcsine is the inverse of the `Sin` function. The
returned angle is measured in radians (not degrees).

`Asin` can be overloaded as operator to accept user-defined types.

Examples:

Dim h As Double
Dim o As Double
Input "Please enter the length of the hypotenuse of a triangle: ", h
Input "Please enter the length of the opposite side of the triangle: ", o
Print ""
Print "The angle between the sides is"; Asin ( o / h )
Sleep

The output would look like:


    Please enter the length of the hypotenuse of a triangle: 5
    Please enter the length of the opposite side of the triangle: 3
    The angle between the sides is 0.6435011087932844
