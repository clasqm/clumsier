STOP
================

Halts program execution, and waits for a key press before ending the program.

Syntax:
declare sub Stop ( byval retval as long = 0 )

Usage:
Stop

Parameters:
`retval`
Error code returned to system.

Description:
Halts the execution of the program and stands by. It's provided as a help to
debugging, as it preserves the memory and doesn't close files. For normal
program termination the `End` keyword should be used. An optional return
value, an integer, can be specified to return an error code to the system. If
no return value is given, a value of 0 is automatically returned.

Note: STOP is not implemented properly yet; currently it is the same as
SYSTEM.

Examples:

Print "this text is shown"
Sleep
Stop
Print "this text will never be shown"

Differences from QB:
None
