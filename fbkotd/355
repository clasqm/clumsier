Operator Mod= (Modulus and Assign)
================

Divides a value and assigns the remainder to a variable

Syntax:
declare operator Mod= ( byref lhs as integer, byref rhs as integer )

Usage:
lhs Mod= rhs

Parameters:

`lhs`
The variable to assign to.

`rhs`
The value to divide `lhs` by.

Description:

This operator divides two values of `Integer` type and assigns the remainder
to its left-hand side (`lhs`) variable. It is functionally equivalent to:

`lhs = lhs Mod rhs`

This operator can be overloaded for user-defined types as a member `Operator`
using the appropriate syntax.

Note: Similarly to the operator '=[>]' (assign), the alternative symbol
'Mod=>' can be also used.

Examples:

Dim n As Integer
n = 11
n Mod= 3
'' The result is 2
Print n
Sleep

Dialect Differences:
In the -lang qb dialect, this operator cannot be overloaded.
