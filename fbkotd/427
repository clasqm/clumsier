RESUME NEXT
================

Error handling statement to resume execution after a jump to an error handler

Syntax:
Resume Next

Description:
`Resume Next` is used in the traditional QB error handling mechanism within an
error handler (called by `On Error`) to return execution to the line after the
one that caused the error. Usually this is used to avoid executing the same
line and causing the error again.

`Resume Next` resets the `Err` value to 0

Examples:

'' Compile with -lang fblite or qb

#lang "fblite"
Dim As Single i, j
On Error Goto ErrHandler
i = 0
j = 5
j = 1 / i ' this line causes a divide-by-zero error; execution jumps to
ErrHandler label
Print "ending..."
End ' end the program so that execution does not fall through to the error
handler again
ErrHandler:
Resume Next ' execution jumps to 'Print "ending..."' line, but j is now in an
undefined state

Dialect Differences:
RESUME NEXT is not supported in the -lang fb dialect. Statements can be
used in its function form to return an error code

If Open( "text" For Input As #1 ) <> 0 Then
  Print "Unable to open file"
End If

Differences from QB:
  * Must compile with -ex or -exx option
