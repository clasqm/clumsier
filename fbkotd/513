Operator IMP= (Implication and Assign)
================

Performs a bitwise-imp (implication) and assigns the result to a variable

Syntax:
declare operator Imp= ( byref lhs as T1, byref rhs as T2 )

Usage:
lhs Imp= rhs

Parameters:

`lhs`
The variable to assign to.

`T1`
Any numeric or boolean type.

`rhs`
The value to perform a bitwise-imp (implication) with `lhs`.

`T2
Any numeric or boolean type.

Description:

This operator performs a bitwise-imp and assigns the result to a variable (for
conversion of a boolean to an integer, false or true boolean value becomes 0
or -1 integer value). It is functionally equivalent to:

`lhs = lhs imp rhs`

`Imp` is a bitwise operator which is the same as (`Not` `lhs`) `Or` `rhs`.
`Imp=` compares each bit of its operands, `lhs` and `rhs`, and if the bit in
`lhs` is 0 or the bit in `rhs` is 1, then the corresponding bit in the first
operand, `lhs`, is set to 1, otherwise it is set to 0.

This operator can be overloaded for user-defined types as a member `Operator`
using the appropriate syntax.

Note: Similarly to the operator '=[>]' (assign), the alternative symbol
'Imp=>' can be also used.

Examples:

Dim As UByte a = &b00110011
Dim As UByte b = &b01010101
a Imp= b
'' Result    a = &b11011101
Print Bin(a)


Dialect Differences:
In the -lang qb dialect, this operator cannot be overloaded.
