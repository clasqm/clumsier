depth as integer = 0, byref bpp as integer = 0, byref pitch as integer = 0,
byref rate as integer = 0, byref driver as string = "``" )

Usage:
Screeninfo [ w ] [, [ h ] [, [ depth ] [ , [ bpp ] [ , [ pitch ] [ , [ rate ]
[, driver ]]]]]

Parameters:

`w`

`depth`
Color depth in bits.

`bpp`
Bytes per pixel.

Description:

This function can be useful to get current mode informations like graphics

If `Screeninfo` is called when no graphics mode is set, it returns the
information about the desktop.

Here's a description of available fields:

w Width of the screen in pixels
h Height of the screen in pixels
depth Current pixel format bits per pixel: this can be 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, or 32
bpp Bytes per pixel
pitch Size of a framebuffer row in bytes
rate Current refresh rate, or 0 if unknown
driver Name of current graphics driver in use, like DirectX (Direct2D added on
new systems) or X11


Examples:

Dim w As Integer, h As Integer
Dim depth As Integer
Dim driver_name As String

Screen 15, 32
' Obtain info about current mode
ScreenInfo w, h, depth,,,,driver_name
Print Str(w) \+ "x" \+ Str(h) \+ "x" \+ Str(depth);
Print " using " \+ driver_name + " driver"
Sleep
' Quit graphics mode and obtain info about desktop
Screen 0
ScreenInfo w, h, depth
Print "Desktop running at " \+ Str(w) \+ "x" \+ Str(h) \+ "x" \+ Str(depth);
