CVS
================

Converts a 32-bit integer or 4-byte string to a single-precision variable

Syntax:
declare function Cvs ( byval i as integer ) as single
declare function Cvs ( byref str as const string ) as single

Usage:
result = Cvs( i )
result = Cvs( str )

Parameters:

`i`
A 32-bit `Integer` with a binary copy of a single-precision variable stored in
it.

`str`
A `String` at least 4 bytes in length with a binary copy of a single-precision
variable stored in it.

Return Value:
Returns a `Single` value holding a binary copy of the input value.

Description:

Does a binary copy from a 32-bit `Integer` or 4-byte `String` to a `Single`
variable. A value of zero (`0.0`) is returned if the string is less than 4
bytes in length. The result will make sense only if the parameter contained a
IEEE-754 formatted single-precision value, such as one generated by `Cvi` or
`Mks`.

This function is useful to read numeric values from buffers without using a
`Type` definition.

Examples:

Dim f As Single, i As Integer
f = 1.125
i = CVI(f)

Print Using "i = _&H&"; Hex(i)
Print Using "cvs(i) = &"; CVS(i)

Differences from QB:
  * QB did not support integer arguments.
