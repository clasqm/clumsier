Bitwise Operators Truth Tables
================

Computed values for the bitwise logical operators.

Binary operators

Operators that take two operands.

Unary operator

Operator that take a single operand.

These logical operators return a value based on the value of their operand(s).
For the binary operators, each bit in the left-hand side value is applied
logically to the corresponding bit in the right-hand side value. The result of
this operation is returned. For the unary operator, (`Operator Not`), the
logic is applied to its right-hand side operand only.


Binary operators

##Operator And (Conjunction)

Bits in the result are set if and only if both of the corresponding bits in
the left and right-hand side operands are set.

Lhs 0 0 1 1
Rhs 0 1 0 1
Result 0 0 0 1

##Operator Eqv (Equivalence)

Bits in the result are set if and only if both of the corresponding bits in
the left and right-hand side operands are both either set or unset.

Lhs 0 0 1 1
Rhs 0 1 0 1
Result 1 0 0 1

##Operator Imp (Implication)

Bits in the result are set if and only if the corresponding bit in the left-
hand side operand implies the bit in the right-hand side operand.

Lhs 0 0 1 1
Rhs 0 1 0 1
Result 1 1 0 1

##Operator Or (Inclusive Disjunction)

Bits in the result are set if either of the corresponding bits in the left and
right-hand side operands are set.

Lhs 0 0 1 1
Rhs 0 1 0 1
Result 0 1 1 1



##Operator Xor (Exclusive Disjunction)

Bits in the result are set if and only if one of the corresponding bits in the
left and right-hand side operands is set.

Lhs 0 0 1 1
Rhs 0 1 0 1
Result 0 1 1 0


Unary operators

##Operator Not (Complement)

Bits in the result are set if the corresponding bits in the right-hand side
operand are unset, and unset if they are set.

Rhs 0 1
Result 1 0
