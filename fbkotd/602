RTRIM
================

Removes surrounding substrings or characters on the right side of a string

Syntax:
declare function Rtrim ( byref str as const string, [ Any ] byref trimset as
const string = " " ) as string
declare function Rtrim ( byref str as const wstring, [ Any ] byref trimset as
const wstring = Wstr(" ") ) as wstring

Usage:
result = Rtrim[$]( str [, [ Any ] trimset ] )

Parameters:

`str`
The source string.

`trimset`
The substring to trim.

Return Value:
Returns the trimmed string.

Description:

This procedure trims surrounding characters from the right (end) of a source
string. Substrings matching `trimset` will be trimmed if specified, otherwise
spaces (ASCII code 32) are trimmed.

If the `Any` keyword is used, any character matching a character in `trimset`
will be trimmed.

All comparisons are case-sensitive.

Examples:

Dim s1 As String = "Article 101  "
Print "'" \+ RTrim(s1) \+ "'"
Print "'" \+ RTrim(s1, " 01") \+ "'"
Print "'" \+ RTrim(s1, Any " 10") \+ "'"

Dim s2 As String = "Test Pattern aaBBaaBaa"
Print "'" \+ RTrim(s2, "Baa") \+ "'"
Print "'" \+ RTrim(s2, Any "Ba") \+ "'"


will produce the output:


 
 
    'Article 101'
    'Article 101  '
    'Article'
    'Test Pattern aaB'
    'Test Pattern '


Platform Differences:

  * DOS version/target of FreeBASIC does not support the wide-character version of `RTrim`.

Dialect Differences:
The string type suffix "$" is required in the -lang qb dialect.
  * The string type suffix "$" is optional in the -lang fblite dialect.
  * The string type suffix "$" is ignored in the -lang fb dialect, warn 
  only with the -w suffix compile option (or -w pedantic compile option).

Differences from QB:
  * QB does not support specifying a `trimset` string or the `ANY` clause.
