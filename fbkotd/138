Compiler Option: -c
=======================

Compile and assemble source file only, do not link

Syntax:
-c

Description:
The `-c` option specifies that any source files listed are to be compiled and
assembled into object files, and not linked into an executable (the default
behavior). When using the "-c" switch, "-m" must be specified when compiling a
main source file.
