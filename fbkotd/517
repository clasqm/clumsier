CHR
================

Returns a string of characters from one or more ASCII integer values

Syntax:
declare function Chr ( byval ch as integer [, ... ] ) as string

Usage:
result = Chr[$]( ch0 [, ch1 ... chN ] )

Parameters:

`ch`
The ASCII integer value of a character.

Return Value:
Returns a string containing the character(s).

Description:

`Chr` returns a string containing the character(s) represented by the ASCII
values passed to it.

When `Chr` is used with numerical constants or literals, the result is
evaluated at compile-time, so it can be used in variable initializers.

`ASC` performs the opposite function, returning the ASCII code of a character
represented by a string.

Examples:

Print "the character represented by";
Print " the ASCII code of 97 is: "; Chr(97)

Print Chr(97, 98, 99) ' prints abc

' s initially has the value "abc"
Dim s As String = Chr(97, 98, 99)

Print s


Dialect Differences:
The string type suffix "$" is required in the -lang qb dialect.
  * The string type suffix "$" is optional in the -lang fblite dialect.
  * The string type suffix "$" is ignored in the -lang fb dialect, warn 
  only with the -w suffix compile option (or -w pedantic compile option).

Differences from QB:
  * FreeBASIC accepts multiple integer values as arguments, QB accepted 
  only one.
  * FreeBASIC evaluates the CHR function at compile time when used with 
  constants or literals.
