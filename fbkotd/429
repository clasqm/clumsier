Constants
================

Description:

Constants are numbers (including booleans) or strings which cannot be changed
after they are defined. For example, 5 will always mean the same number.

In FreeBASIC, a constant definition differs from a variable definition by
usage of the `Const` command.

Such constants are then available globally, meaning that once defined, you can
use the word to refer to a constant anywhere in your program.

After being defined with the `Const` command, constants cannot be altered. If
code tries to alter a constant, an error message will result upon code
compilation.

Examples:

Declare Sub PrintConstants ()
Const FirstNumber = 1
Const SecondNumber = 2
Const FirstString = "First string."
Const FirstBoolean = False
Const SecondBoolean = True
Print FirstNumber, SecondNumber 'This will print 1      2
Print FirstString 'This will print First string.
Print FirstBoolean, SecondBoolean 'This will print false      true
Print
PrintConstants ()

Sub PrintConstants ()
    Print FirstNumber, SecondNumber 'This will also print 1        2
    Print FirstString 'This will also print First string.
    Print FirstBoolean, SecondBoolean 'This will also print false      true
End Sub
