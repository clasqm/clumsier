LOCAL
================

Error handling statement to set the current error handler

Syntax:
On Local Error Goto label

Description:
The `Local` clause in an `On Error` construction allows to define an error
handler in the same `Sub` or `Function` the `On Local Error` is in.

Remark: Presently, the `Local` clause (authorized only inside Sub/Function) is
ignored by the compiler, and the error handler can be either in the scope of
the same procedure the On [Local] Error is in, or in the main part of the
module (if defined before the procedure).
Exception if -gen gcc is used: when the On [Local] Error is inside a
Sub/Function, the error handler also must always be inside that same
procedure.

Examples:

'' compile with -lang fblite or qb
#lang "fblite"
Declare Sub foo
foo
Print "ok"
Sleep
Sub foo
  Dim errno As Integer
  On Local Error Goto fail
  Open "xzxwz.zwz" For Input As #1
  On Local Error Goto 0
  Exit Sub
fail:                  ' here starts the error handler
  errno = Err
  Print "Error "; errno      ' just print the error number
  Sleep
End Sub

Differences from QB:
  * The LOCAL clause comes from PDS 7.1. QB 4.5 does not allow local error 
  handling.
