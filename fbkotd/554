LOWORD
================

Gets the lowest 16bit word of the operand.

Syntax:
#define Loword( expr ) (Cast(Uinteger, expr) and &h0000FFFF)

Usage:
result = Loword( expr )

Parameters:

`expr`
A numeric expression, converted to an `Uinteger` value.

Return Value:
Returns the value of the low word of expr.

Description:

This macro converts the numeric expression `expr` to an `Uinteger` value, then
expands to an `Uinteger` representing the value of its least-significant (low)
16bit word.

Examples:

Dim N As UInteger

'Note there are 32 bits
N = &b10000000000000011111111111111111

Print "N is                                       "; N
Print "The binary representation of N is          "; Bin(N)
Print "The most significant word (MSW) of N is    "; HiWord(N)
Print "The least significant word (LSW) of N is   "; LoWord(N)
Print "The binary representation of the MSW is    "; Bin(HiWord(N))
Print "The binary representation of the LSW is    "; Bin(LoWord(N))

Sleep


The output would look like:

 
 
    N Is                                       2147614719
    The Binary representation of N Is          10000000000000011111111111111111
    The most significant word (MSW) of N Is    32769
    The least significant word (LSW) of N Is   65535
    The Binary representation of the MSW Is    1000000000000001
    The Binary representation of the LSW Is    1111111111111111
