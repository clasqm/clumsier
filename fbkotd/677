INSTR
================

Locates the first occurrence of a substring or character within a string

Syntax:
declare function Instr ( byref str as const string, [ Any ] byref substring as
const string ) as integer
declare function Instr ( byref str as const wstring, [ Any ] byref substring
as const wstring ) as integer
declare function Instr ( byval start as integer, byref str as const string, [
Any ] byref substring as const string ) as integer
declare function Instr ( byval start as integer, byref str as const wstring, [
Any ] byref substring as const wstring ) as integer

Usage:
first = Instr( [ start, ] str, [ Any ] substring )

Parameters:

`str`
The string to be searched.

`substring`
The substring to find.

`start`
The position in `str` at which the search will begin. The first character
starts at position 1.

Return Value:
The position of the first occurrence of `substring` in `str`.

Description:

Locates the position of the first occurrence of a substring or character
within a string. In the first form of `Instr` (without `start` parameter), the
search begins at the first character.

Zero (0) is returned if: either `substring` is not found, either `str` or
`substring` are empty strings, or `start` < 1.

If the `Any` keyword is specified, `Instr` returns the first occurrence of any
character in `substring`.

Examples:

' It will return 4
Print InStr("abcdefg", "de")

' It will return 0
Print InStr("abcdefg", "h")

' It will search for any of the characters "f", "b", "c", and return 2 as "b"
is encountered first
Print InStr("abcdefg", Any "fbc")


Dim test As String
Dim idx As Integer

test = "abababab"
idx = InStr(test, "b")

Do While idx > 0 'if not found loop will be skipped
    Print """b"" at " & idx
    idx = InStr(idx + 1, Test, "b")
Loop


'A Unicode example:
dim text as wstring*20
text = "Привет, мир!"
print instr(text,"ет") ' displays 5



Platform Differences:

* The wide-character string version of `Instr` is not supported for DOS target.

Differences from QB:
  * QB returns `start` if `search` is a zero length string.
  * QB does not support Unicode.
