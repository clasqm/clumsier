relationship holds true, or false (0) if not.

##Operator < (Less than)
Compares the less than relation of two operands.

##Operator <= (Less than or equal)
Compares the less than or equal relation of two operands.

##Operator >= (Greater than or equal)
Compares the greater than or equal relation of two operands.

##Operator > (Greater than)
Compares the greater than relation of two operands.
