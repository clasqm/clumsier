ATAN2
================

Returns the arctangent of a ratio

Syntax:
declare function ATan2 ( byval y as double, byval x as double ) as double

Usage:
result = ATan2( y, x )

Parameters:

`y`
Vertical component of the ratio.

`x`
Horizontal component of the ratio.

Return Value:
The angle whose tangent is `y/x`, in radians, in the range [-Pi..Pi].

Description:

`ATan2` returns the arctangent of the ratio `y/x` as a `Double` within the
range of -Pi to Pi. The arctangent is the inverse of the `Tan` function. The
returned angle is measured in radians (not degrees).

`ATan2` cannot be overloaded as operator to accept user-defined types.

Examples:

Print Atan2 ( 4, 5 )     'this is the same as PRINT ATN ( 4 / 5 )

The output would be:

    0.6747409422235527
