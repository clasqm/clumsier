MKL
================

Does a binary copy from a `long` variable to a `string`, setting its length to
4 bytes

Syntax:
declare function Mkl ( byval number as long ) as string

Usage:
result = Mkl( number )

Parameters:

`number`
A `long` variable to binary copy to a `string`.

Return Value:
Returns a `string` with a binary copy of the `long`.

Description:

Does a binary copy from a `Long` variable to a `string`, setting its length to
4 bytes. The resulting string can be read back to a `Long` by `Cvl`.

This function is useful to write numeric values to buffers without using a
`Type` definition.

Examples:

Dim a As Long, b As String
a = 4534
b = MKL(a)
Print a, CVL(b)
Sleep

Dialect Differences:
The string type suffix "$" is required in the -lang qb dialect.
  * The string type suffix "$" is optional in the -lang fblite dialect.
  * The string type suffix "$" is ignored in the -lang fb dialect, warn
  only with the -w suffix compile option (or -w pedantic compile option).

Differences from QB:
  * None
