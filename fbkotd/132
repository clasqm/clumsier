Compiler Option: -nostrip
===========================

Do not strip symbol information from the output file

Syntax:
-nostrip

Description:
The `-nostrip` compiler option explicitly prevents fbc from passing the option
to strip (remove) all symbols to the linker. Object modules and libraries will
retain any symbols present after linking.

Platform Differences:
fbc strips all symbols by default on Dos and Windows platforms only
