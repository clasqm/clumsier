#LINE
================

Preprocessor directive to set the current line number and file name

Syntax:
#line number [ "name" ]

Parameters:
`number `
new line number

`"name"`
new file name (optional)

Description:

Informs the compiler of a change in line number and file name and updates the
`__FILE__` and `__LINE__` macro values accordingly.

Both compile time messages and run-time messages are affected by this
directive.

This directive allows other programs to generate source code for the FreeBASIC
compiler and have it return warning and/or error messages that refer to the
original source used by the other program.

Examples:

#line 155 "outside.src"
Error 1000
'' Output is:
'' Aborting due to runtime error 1000 at line 157 of outside.src()

Differences from QB:
New to FreeBASIC
