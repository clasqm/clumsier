Compiler Option: -gen
================

Sets the backend code emitter.

Syntax:
-gen < backend >

Parameters:

`backend`

`gas` for x86 GAS assembly, `gcc` for GNU C, `gas64` for x86_64 GAS assembly,
`llvm` for LLVM IR.

Description:

The `-gen` compiler option sets the backend code emitter and assembler.

-gen gas

The compiler will emit GAS assembler code to a `.asm` file which will then be
compiled to an object file using '`as`'. This is fbc's original x86 code
generation backend.

-gen gcc

The compiler will emit C code to a `.c` file which will then be compiled to an
.asm file using '`gcc`' as a high level assembler. The C backend is intended
to make FB portable to more platforms than just x86. This requires gcc to be
installed so that fbc can invoke it to compile the C code, also see Installing
gcc for -gen gcc.

-gen gas64

The compiler will emit GAS assembler code (64-bit) to a `.asm` file which will
then be compiled to an object file using '`as`'.

-gen llvm

The compiler will emit LLVM IR code to a `.ll` file which will then be
compiled to an .asm file using '`llc`'. The LLVM backend is still a work in
progress. It is intended for the same purpose as the C backend, and could
theoretically solve some of the C backend's problems, such as debugging meta
data support.
