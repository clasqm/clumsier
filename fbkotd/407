UINTEGER
================

Standard data type: 32-bit or 64-bit unsigned, same size as `SizeOf(Any Ptr)`.
Equivalent to `Unsigned Integer`.

Syntax:
dim variable as Uinteger
dim variable as Uinteger<bits>

Parameters:

`bits`
a numeric constant expression indicating the size in bits of unsigned integer
desired. The values allowed are `8`, `16`, `32` or `64`.

Description:

32-bit or 64-bit unsigned whole-number data type, depending on the platform.

If an explicit bit size is given, a data type is provided that can hold values
from `0` up to `(1ULL Shl (bits)) - 1`. The selected data type is `UByte` for
UInteger<8>, `UShort` for UInteger<16>, `ULong` for UInteger<32> and
`ULongInt` for UInteger<64>.

Examples:

#ifdef __FB_64BIT__
    Dim x As UInteger = 0
    Dim y As UInteger = &HFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
    Print "UInteger Range = "; x; " to "; y
#else
    Dim x As UInteger = 0
    Dim y As UInteger = &HFFFFFFFF
    Print "UInteger Range = "; x; " to "; y
#endif
