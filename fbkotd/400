$INCLUDE
================

Metacommand statement to include contents of another source file

Syntax:

'$Include [once]: 'file'

or

rem $Include [once]: 'file'

Description:
`$include` inserts source code from another file at the point where the
`$include` metacommand appears. This has the effect of compiling the source
code from the include file as though it were part of the source file that
includes it. Once the compiler has reached the end of the include file, the
original source file continues to be compiled.

The `once` specifier tells the compiler to include the file only once even if
it is included several times by the source code.

`'$Include:` exists for compatibility with QuickBASIC. It is recommended to
use `#include` instead.

Examples:

' header.bi file
Type FooType
    Bar As Byte
    Barbeque As Byte
End Type
Dim Foo As FooType

'' compile with -lang fblite or qb
#lang "fblite"
'' main.bas file
'$INCLUDE: "header.bi"
Foo.Bar = 1
Foo.Barbeque = 2

Dialect Differences:
Only available in the -lang fblite and -lang qb dialects.

Differences from QB:
  * None
