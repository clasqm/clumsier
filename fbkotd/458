SETDATE
================

Sets the current system date

Syntax:
declare function Setdate ( byref newdate as const string ) as long

Usage:
result = Setdate( newdate )

Parameters:

`newdate`
the new date to set

Return Value:
Returns zero on success or non-zero on failure on all ports except DOS.

Description:

To set the date you just format `newdate` and send to `Setdate` in a valid
format following one of the following: `"mm-dd-yy"`, `"mm-dd-yyyy"`,
`"mm/dd/yy"`, or `"mm/dd/yyyy"` (`mm` is the month, `dd` is the day, `yy` or
`yyyy` is the year). Two-digit year numbers are based on the year 1900.

The error code returned by `Setdate` can be checked using `Err` in the next
line. The function version of `Setdate` returns directly the error code as a
32 bit `Long`.

Examples:

Dim m As String, d As String, y As String
m = "03" 'march
d = "13" 'the 13th
y = "1994" 'good ol' days
SetDate m + "/" \+ d + "/" \+ y


Platform Differences:

  * On Windows the privilege SE_SYSTEMTIME_NAME is required, which 
  typically means that the calling process has to be run with administrator 
  privileges.
  * On Linux the capability CAP_SYS_TIME is required, which typically 
  means that the calling process has to run as root/superuser.

Differences from QB:
  * The DATE statement was used in QB and the syntax was "DATE = string"
