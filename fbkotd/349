Operator /= (Divide and Assign)
================

Divides and assigns a value to a variable

Syntax:
declare operator /= ( byref lhs as T1, byref rhs as T2 )

Usage:

Parameters:
`lhs`

The variable to assign to.

`T1`
Any numeric type.

`rhs`

Description:
This operator divides and assigns a value to a variable. It is functionally
equivalent to:
`lhs = lhs / rhs`

This operator can be overloaded for user-defined types as a member `Operator`
using the appropriate syntax.

Note: Similarly to the operator '=[>]' (assign), the alternative symbol '/=>'
can be also used.

Dim n As Double
n = 6
n /= 2.2
Print n
Sleep
