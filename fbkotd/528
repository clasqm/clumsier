FILEEXISTS
================

Tests the existence of a file

Syntax:
declare function FileExists ( byval filename as zstring ptr ) as long

Usage:
#include "file.bi"
result = FileExists( filename )

`or`

#include "vbcompat.bi"
result = FileExists( filename )

Parameters:

`filename`
Filename to test for existence.

Return Value:
Returns non-zero (`-1`) if the file exists, otherwise returns zero (`0`).

Description:

`FileExists` tests for the existence of a file.
Internally, it may issue an Open() and a Close() function, which may have
consequences - eg, any existing `Lock`(s) on the file may be released.
Depending on the exact requirements, alternative methods of checking for file
existence may be to use the `Dir()` function (being careful of attributes and
ensuring the path doesn't contain wildcards), or to try `Open`ing the file and
checking the return value for success.

Examples:

#include "vbcompat.bi"

Dim filename As String

Print "Enter a filename: "
Line Input filename

If FileExists( filename ) Then
  Print "File found: " & filename
Else
  Print "File not found: " & filename
End If


Platform Differences:

  * Linux requires the `filename` case matches the real name of the file. Windows and DOS are case insensitive.
  * Path separators in Linux are forward slashes `/`. Windows uses backward slashes `\` but it allows for forward slashes. DOS uses backward `\` slashes.
