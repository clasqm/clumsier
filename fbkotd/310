DEFINT
================

Specifies a default data type for a range of variable names

Syntax:
Defint start_letter[-end_letter ][, ...]

Parameters:

`start_letter`
the first letter in the range

`end_letter`
the last letter in the range

Description:
`Defint` specifies that variables and arrays which aren't declared with a data
type - or not declared at all - are implicitly declared of type `Integer` if
the first letter of their names matches a certain letter or lies within an
inclusive range of letters.

Examples:

This will make `iNumber` an `Integer` number since its first letter starts
with `i`.
