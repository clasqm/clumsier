Compiler Option: -forcelang
================

Provides QuickBASIC or backward compatibility

Syntax:
-forcelang dialect

Parameters:

`dialect`
The dialect to use in compilation, one of `fb` (default), `fblite`, `qb` or
`deprecated`.

Description:

The `-forcelang` compiler option changes the way source code is interpreted,
and is meant as a tool to users wanting traditional QuickBASIC-like behavior,
or behavior deprecated from previous versions of FreeBASIC. It overrides any
`#lang` statements within the code.

The intrinsic macro `__FB_LANG__` is set to the string name of the dialect
specified on the command line, or `"fb"` by default.

To learn more about the differences between each of these language dialects,
see Compiler Dialects.

fb
This is the default dialect, and allows compilation of source code adhering to
the most recent version of the FreeBASIC language.

fblite
This dialect provides support for FreeBASIC syntax and functionality, but with
a more traditional QuickBASIC programming style.

qb
This dialect provides the best support for older QuickBASIC code.

deprecated
This dialect is for backward compatibility with some previous versions of
FreeBASIC, however, this dialect may not exist in future versions. Programmers
should consider using the "fblite" dialect instead.
