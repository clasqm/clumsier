About the FreeBASIC project.

The FreeBASIC project is a set of cross-platform development tools initially
created by Andre Victor, consisting of a compiler, GNU-based assembler, linker
and archiver, and supporting runtime libraries, including a software-based
graphics library. The compiler, `fbc`, currently supports building for
i386-based architectures on the DOS, Linux, Windows and Xbox platforms. The
project also contains thin bindings (header files) to some popular 3rd party
libraries such as the C runtime library, Allegro, SDL, OpenGL, GTK+, the
Windows API and many others, as well as example programs for many of these
libraries.

FreeBASIC is a high-level programming language supporting procedural, object-
orientated and meta-programming paradigms, with a syntax compatible to
Microsoft QuickBASIC. In fact, the FreeBASIC project originally began as an
attempt to create a code-compatible, free alternative to QuickBASIC, but it
has since grown into a powerful development tool. FreeBASIC can be seen to
extend the capabilities of QuickBASIC in a number of ways, supporting more
data types, language constructs, programming styles, and modern platforms and
APIs.
