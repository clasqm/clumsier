FILECOPY
================

Copies a file

Syntax:
declare function FileCopy ( byval source as zstring ptr, byval destination as
zstring ptr ) as long

Usage:
#include "file.bi"
FileCopy source, destination

`
or
`

#include "file.bi"
result = FileCopy( source, destination )

Parameters:

`source`
A `string` argument specifying the filename of the file to copy from. This
file must exist.

`destination`
A `string` argument specifying the filename of the file to copy to. This file
will be overwritten if it exists. This file should not be currently referenced
by any open file handles.

Return Value:
Returns `0` on success, or `1` if an error occurred.

Description:

Copies the contents of the source file into the destination file, overwriting
the destination file if it already exists.
It is necessary to `#Include` either `"file.bi"` or `"vbcompat.bi"` in order
to gain access to this function.

The error code returned by `FileCopy` can be checked using `Err` in the next
line. The function version of `FileCopy` returns directly the error code as a
32 bit `Long`.

Examples:

#include "file.bi"
FileCopy "source.txt", "destination.txt"


Platform Differences:

  * Linux requires the `filename` case matches the real name of the file. 
  Windows and DOS are case insensitive.
  * Path separators in Linux are forward slashes `/`. Windows uses 
  backward slashes `\` but it allows forward slashes. DOS uses backward 
  slashes `\`.

Differences from QB:
  * New to FreeBASIC. Existed in Visual Basic.
