SPC
================

Output function to skip spaces when writing to screen or file

Syntax:
Spc( columns )

Usage:
Print Spc( spaces ) [(, | ;)] ...

Parameters:

`spaces`
number of spaces to skip

Description:
`Spc` skips over the given number of `spaces` when `Print`ing to screen or to
a file. The character cells skipped over are left unchanged.

Examples:

Print "foo"; Spc(5); "bar"
Print "hello"; Spc(4); "world"

'' Uses Spc to justify text instead of Tab

Dim As String A1, B1, A2, B2

A1 = "Jane"
B1 = "Doe"
A2 = "Bob"
B2 = "Smith"

Print "FIRST NAME"; Spc(35 \- 10); "LAST NAME"
Print "\----------"; Spc(35 \- 10); "\----------"
Print A1; Spc(35 \- Len(A1)); B1
Print A2; Spc(35 \- Len(A2)); B2

The output would look like:

    FIRST NAME                         LAST NAME
    ----------                         ----------
    Jane                               Doe
    Bob                                Smith


Differences from QB:
  * In QBASIC, spaces were printed in the gap, while in FreeBASIC, the 
  characters are just skipped over and left untouched. The `Space` function 
  can still be used to achieve this effect.
