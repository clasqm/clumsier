OPTION DYNAMIC
================

Specifies variable-length array declarations

Syntax:
Option Dynamic

Description:
`Option Dynamic` is a statement that specifies that any following array
declarations are variable-length, whether they are declared with constant
subscript ranges or not. This remains in effect for the rest of the module in
which `Option Dynamic` is used, and can be overridden with `Option Static`. It
is equivalent to the `'$Dynamic` metacommand.

Examples:

'' Compile with "-lang fblite" compiler switch

#lang "fblite"
Dim foo(99) As Integer      ' declares a fixed-length array
Option Dynamic
Dim bar(99) As Integer      ' declares a variable-length array
' ...
ReDim bar(199)              ' resize the array

Dialect Differences:
Only available in the -lang fblite and -lang qb dialects.

Differences from QB:
New to FreeBASIC
