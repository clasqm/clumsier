__FB_OPTION_BYVAL__
================

Intrinsic define (macro value) set by the compiler

Syntax:
__FB_OPTION_BYVAL__

Description:
Indicates if parameters to a `Function` or `Sub` are passed by reference as
with `Byref`, or by value as with `Byval` by default when the by value / by
reference specifier is not explicitly stated.

`__FB_OPTION_BYVAL__` is set to non-zero (-1) if by default parameters are
passed value, and zero (0) if by default parameters are passed by reference.

The default for passing parameters by reference or by value is determined by
the -lang command line option used during compilation or usage of `Option
Byval` in the source file.

Examples:
#if( __FB_OPTION_BYVAL__ <> 0 )
  #error Option ByVal must Not be used With This source
#endif
