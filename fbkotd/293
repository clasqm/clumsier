DEFSNG
================

Specifies a default data type for a range of variable names

Syntax:
Defsng start_letter[-end_letter ][, ...]

Parameters:
`start_letter`
the first letter in the range

`end_letter`
the last letter in the range

Description:

`Defsng` specifies that variables and arrays which aren't declared with a data
type - or not declared at all - are implicitly declared of type `Single` if
the first letter of their names matches a certain letter or lies within an
inclusive range of letters.

Examples:

This will make `sNumber` and `yNumber` a `Single`-precision decimal number
since it is in the range of s-z.

'' Compile with -lang fblite or qb
#lang "fblite"
DefSng s-z
Dim sNumber, yNumber

Dialect Differences:
Only available in the -lang qb and -lang fblite dialects.

Differences from QB:
None
