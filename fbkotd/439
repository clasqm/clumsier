Operator & (String concatenation with conversion)
================

Concatenates two strings, converting non-strings to strings as needed

Syntax:
declare operator & ( byref lhs as T, byref rhs as U ) as V

Usage:
result = lhs & rhs

Parameters:

`lhs`
The left-hand side expression to concatenate.

`T`
Any standard data type or user-defined type that can be converted to a
standard data type.

`rhs`
The right-hand side expression to concatenate.

`U`
Any standard data type or user-defined type that can be converted to a
standard data type.

`V`
The resultant string type (varies with operands).

Description:

This operator concatenates two expressions. If either of the expressions is
not a string type, it is converted to `String` with `Str`.

If either of the expressions is a `Wstring`, a `Wstring` is returned,
otherwise a `String` is returned.

This operator can be overloaded to accept user-defined types.

Note: This operator exists in C/C++ with a different meaning - there it
performs a bitwise And.

Examples:

Dim As String A,C
Dim As Single B
A="The result is: "
B=124.3
C=A & B
Print C
Sleep

Output:
 
    The result is: 124.3
