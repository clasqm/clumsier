MKLONGINT
================

Does a binary copy from a `longint` variable to a `string`, setting its length
to 8 bytes

Syntax:
declare function Mklongint ( byval number as longint ) as string

Usage:
result = Mklongint[$]( number )

Parameters:

`number`
A `longint` variable to binary copy to a `string`.

Return Value:
Returns a `string` with a binary copy of the `longint`.

Description:

Does a binary copy from a `Longint` variable to a string, setting its length
to 8 bytes. The resulting string can be read back to a longint by `Cvlongint`

This function is useful to write numeric values to buffers without using a
`Type` definition.

Examples:

Dim a As LongInt, b As String
a = 4534
b = MKLongInt(a)
Print a, CVLongInt(b)
Sleep

Dialect Differences:
Not available in the -lang qb dialect unless referenced with the
alias `__Mklongint`.
  * The string type suffix "$" is optional in the -lang fblite dialect.
  * The string type suffix "$" is ignored in the -lang fb dialect, warn only with the -w suffix compile option (or -w pedantic compile option).

Differences from QB:
