Symbols
==========

In order to be able to make the transition from tokens to AST, the parser
needs to be able to recognize functions, variables, types, etc. The `symb`
module keeps track of all these symbols and their namespaces and scopes. The
parser can do lookups in the current scope, or in just specific namespaces.
Many AST nodes have a corresponding symbol (e.g. variables and functions).
