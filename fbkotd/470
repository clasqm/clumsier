Operator &= (Concatenate and Assign)
================

Appends and assigns a string onto another string

Syntax:
declare operator &= ( byref lhs as string, byref rhs as T2 )
declare operator &= ( byref lhs as wstring, byref rhs as T2 )

Usage:
lhs &= rhs

Parameters:

`lhs`
The string to assign to.

`rhs`
The value to append to `lhs`.

`T2`
Any numeric, string or user-defined type that can be converted to a string.

Description:

This operator appends one string onto another. The right-hand side expression
(`rhs`) is converted to a string before concatenation. It is functionally
equivalent to,


lhs = lhs & rhs

where the result is assigned back to the left-hand side string.

This operator can be overloaded for user-defined types as a member `Operator`
using the appropriate syntax.

Note: This operator exists in C/C++ with a different meaning - there it
performs a bitwise `And=`.
Note: Similarly to the operator '=[>]' (assign), the alternative symbol '&=>'
can be also used.

Examples:

Dim s As String = "Hello, "
s &= " world!"
Print s

will produce the output:

 
    Hello, world!


Dialect Differences:
In the -lang qb dialect, this operator cannot be overloaded.
