Operator VARPTR (Variable pointer)
================

Returns the address of a variable or object

Syntax:
declare operator Varptr ( byref lhs as T ) as T ptr

`
Syntax:
result = Varptr ( lhs )

Parameters:

`lhs`
A variable or object.

`T`
Any data type.

Return Value:
Returns the address of a variable or object.

Description:

This operator returns the address of its operand.

When the operand is of type `String`, the address of the internal string
descriptor is returned. Use `Operator Strptr (String pointer)` to retrieve the
address of the string data.

The operand cannot be an array, but may be an array element. For example,
`"Varptr(myarray(0))"` returns the address of `"myarray(0)"`.

`Operator @ (Address of)`, when used with variables or objects, has identical
behavior.

Examples:

Dim a As Integer, addr As Integer
a = 10

'' place the address of a in addr
addr = CInt( VarPtr(a) )

'' change all 4 bytes (size of INTEGER) of a
Poke Integer, addr, -1000
Print a

'' place the address of a in addr (same as above)
addr = CInt( @a )

'' print the least or most significant byte, depending on the CPU endianess
Print Peek( addr )
