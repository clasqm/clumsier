ON...GOSUB
================

Calls a label based on an expression

Syntax:
On expression Gosub label1[, ...]

Description:
Branches to different labels depending on the value of expression. An
expression value of 1 will branch to the first label, a value of 2 to the
second, etc. If the value of expression is zero (0) or greater than the number
of items in the list, execution continues on the next statement following the
`On...Gosub`.

This statement behaves exactly like `Gosub` and execution may return to the
statement following the `On...Gosub` using `Return`.

It is recommended that the structured `Select Case` conditional statement be
used instead of `On...Gosub`.

Examples:

'' Compile with -lang qb

'$lang: "qb"

choice = 3
On choice GoSub labela, labelb, labelc
Print "Good bye."
End

labela:
Print "choice a"
Return

labelb:
Print "choice b"
Return

labelc:
Print "choice c"
Return


Dialect Differences:
Only available in the -lang qb and -lang fblite dialects.
  * `On Gosub` support is disabled by default in the -lang fblite unless 
  the `Option Gosub` statement is used.

Differences from QB:
  * FreeBASIC does not generate a run-time error if `expression` is 
  negative or greater than 255.
