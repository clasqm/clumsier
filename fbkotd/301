FreeBASIC Linux questions:

##FreeBASIC gives me an error 'ld: can't find -lX11' or something similar!

FreeBASIC uses ld to link its files under linux. This program requires that
any libraries you use have the '-dev' versions installed. For example, for the
above error message, you'd want to install xlib-dev for your distribution.
Other common errors are for glibc, which requires glibc-dev, and sdl, which
requires sdl-dev. Most distributions make these easily available on your
install media.
