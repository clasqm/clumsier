================

Hidden instance parameter passed to non-static member functions in a `Type` or
`Class`

Syntax:
this.fieldname

or

With this

.fieldname

End With

Description:
`This` is a reference to an instance of a `Type` or `Class` that is passed
(through a hidden `Byref parameter`) to all non-static member functions of
that type or class. Non-static member functions are procedures declared inside
the body of a `Type` or `Class` and include `Sub`, `Function`, `Constructor`,
`Destructor`, assignment or `Cast` `Operator`, and `Property` procedures.

The `This` additional parameter has the same data type as the `Type` or
`Class` in which the procedure is declared.

The `This` parameter can be used just like any other variable, ie., pass it to
procedures taking an object of the same type, call other member procedures and
access member data using `Operator . (Member access)`, etc.

Most of the time, using `This` explicitly for member access is unnecessary;
member procedures can refer to other members of the instance which they are
passed directly by name, without having to qualify it with `This` and
`Operator . (Member access)`. The only times when you need to qualify member
names with `This` is when the member is shadowed, for example by duplicating
its name for a local variable or parameter. In these situations, qualifying
the member name is the only way to refer to these masked member names.

Examples:

Type sometype
    Declare Sub MyCall()
    value As Integer
End Type

Dim example As sometype

'' Set element test to 0
example.value = 0
Print example.value

example.MyCall()

'' Output should now be 10
Print example.value

End 0

Sub sometype.MyCall()
    This.value = 10
End Sub
