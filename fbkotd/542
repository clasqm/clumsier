Operator $ (Non-Escaped String Literal)
================

Explicitly indicates that a string literal should not be processed for escape
sequences.

Syntax:
$"text"

Parameters:

`$`

The preprocessor non-escaped operator

`"text"`
The string literal

Description:

This operator explicitly indicates that the string literal following it
(wrapped in double quotes) should not be processed for escape sequences. This
a preprocessor operator and can only be used with string literals at compile
time.

The default behavior for string literals is that they not be processed for
escape sequences. However, `Option Escape` in the -lang fblite dialect can be
used to override this default behaviour causing all strings to be processed
for escape sequences.

Use the ! operator (Escaped String Literal) to explicitly indicate that a
string should be processed for escape sequences.

Examples:

'' Compile with -lang fblite or qb

#lang "fblite"

Print "Default"
Print "Backslash  : \\\"
Print !"Backslash !: \\\"
Print $"Backslash $: \\\"
Print

Option Escape

Print "Option Escape"
Print "Backslash  : \\\"
Print !"Backslash !: \\\"
Print $"Backslash $: \\\"
Print

'' OUTPUT:

'' Default
'' Backslash  : \\\
'' Backslash !: \
'' Backslash $: \\\

'' Option Escape
'' Backslash  : \
'' Backslash !: \
'' Backslash $: \\\
