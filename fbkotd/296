OPTION NOGOSUB
================

Disables support for `Gosub` and `On Gosub`.

Syntax:
Option Nogosub

Description:
`Option Nogosub` disables support for `Gosub` and `Return` (from gosub).

Because `Return` could mean return-from-gosub or return-from-procedure,
`Option Gosub` and `Option Nogosub` can be used to enable and disable `Gosub`
support. When `Gosub` support is disabled, `Return` is then recognized as
return-from-procedure.

Examples:

'' Compile with the "-lang qb" compiler switch
'$lang: "qb"
'' turn off gosub support
Option nogosub
Function foo() As Integer
    Return 1234
End Function
Print foo

Dialect Differences:
Only available in the -lang fblite and -lang qb dialects.

Differences from QB:
