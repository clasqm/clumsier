Compiler Option: -l
===================

Add a library file to the linker's list.

Syntax:
-l < libname >

Parameters:
`libname`
Name of the library to link in. The library file name's extension should not
be included. For example, when using `-l something`, the linker will look for
the files:

  * `libsomething.a`
  * `libsomething.dll.a` (Windows)
  * `something.dll` (Windows)
  * `libsomething.so` (Linux)

Description:

The `-l` compiler option adds a library file to the linker's list, to be
linked into the final executable or library if needed to satisfy dependencies.
