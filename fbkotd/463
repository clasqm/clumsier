CONDBROADCAST
================

Restarts all threads `Condwait`ing for the handle

Syntax:
declare sub Condbroadcast ( byval handle as any ptr )

Usage:
Condbroadcast ( handle )

Parameters:

`handle`
The handle of a conditional variable.

Description:

Once the conditional is `Condcreate` and the threads are started, one of more
of them (including the implicit main thread executing main program) can be set
to `Condwait` for the conditional, they will be stopped until some other
thread `Condsignal`s that the waiting thread can restart. `Condbroadcast` can
be used to restart all threads waiting for the conditional. At the end of the
program `Conddestroy` must be used to avoid leaking resources in the OS.

Condbroadcast must be used instead of `Condsignal` to restart all threads
waiting on the conditional.

Examples:

See `Condcreate`

Platform Differences:

  * Condbroadcast is not available with the DOS version / target of 
  FreeBASIC, because multithreading is not supported by DOS kernel nor 
  the used extender.
  * In Linux the threads are always started in the order they are created, 
  this can't be assumed in Win32. It's an OS, not a FreeBASIC issue.

Dialect Differences:
Threading is not allowed in -lang qb

Differences from QB:
New to FreeBASIC
