Compiler Option: -mt
===================

Link with thread-safe runtime library

Syntax:
-mt

Description:
The `-mt` compiler option forces linking with thread-safe runtime library for
multithreaded applications. The thread-safe version is always used
automatically if the FreeBASIC built-in threading functions are used, so you
only need to specify this option if using your own threading routines.

The intrinsic macro `__FB_MT__` is set to non-zero (-1) if the `-mt` option
was specified, or whether one of the `ThreadtCreate` or `ThreadCall` keywords
is used more above in the source code. Otherwise, it is set to zero (0).
