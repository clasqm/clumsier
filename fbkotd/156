Compiler Option: -t
========================

Set stack size in kilobytes

Syntax:
-t < stack size >

Parameters:
`stack size`
Stack size in kilobytes.

Description:
The `-t` compiler option sets the stack size in kilobytes (defaults to 1024
KBytes for 32-bit targets, increased to 2048 KBytes for 64-bit targets if fbc
version >= 1.08). The local arrays are created in the stack, so 1 MB or 2 MB
of stack is not always enough.

Platform Differences:
Supported on Windows, Cygwin and DOS only.
