OPTION STATIC
================

Reverts to default array declaration behavior

Syntax:
Option Static

Description:
`Option Static` is a statement that overrides the behavior of `Option
Dynamic`, that is, arrays declared with constant subscript ranges are fixed-
length. This remains in effect for the rest of the module in which `Option
Static` is used, and can be overridden with `Option Dynamic`. It is equivalent
to the `'$Static` metacommand.

Examples:

'' Compile with the "-lang fblite" compiler switch  
#lang "fblite"
Option Dynamic
Dim foo(100) As Integer         ' declares a variable-length array
Option Static
Dim bar(100) As Integer         ' declares a fixed-length array

Dialect Differences:
Only available in the -lang fblite and -lang qb dialects.

Differences from QB:
New to FreeBASIC
