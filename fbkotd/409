SGN
================

Returns the sign part of a number

Syntax:
declare function Sgn ( byval number as integer ) as integer
declare function Sgn ( byval number as longint ) as longint
declare function Sgn ( byval number as double ) as double

Usage:
result = Sgn( number )

Parameters:

`number`
the number to find the sign of

Return Value:
Returns the sign part of `number`.

  * If number is greater than zero, then `Sgn` returns `1`.
  * If number is equal to zero, then `Sgn` returns `0`.
  * If number is less than zero, then `Sgn` returns `-1`.

Description:

The required `number` argument can be any valid numeric expression. Unsigned
numbers will be treated as if they were signed, i.e. if the highest bit is set
the number will be treated as negative, and `-1` will be returned.

The `Sgn` unary `operator` can be overloaded with user defined types.

Examples:

Dim N As Integer = 0

Print Sgn ( -1.87 )
Print Sgn ( 0 )
Print Sgn ( 42.658 )
Print Sgn ( N )

The output would look like:

    -1
    0
    1
    0

Dialect Differences:
In the -lang qb dialect, this operator cannot be overloaded.

Differences from QB:
  * None
