================

Specifies a default data type for a range of variable names

Syntax:
Defushort start_letter[-end_letter ][, ...]

Parameters:

`start_letter`
the first letter in the range

`end_letter`
the last letter in the range

Description:

`Defushort` specifies that variables and arrays which aren't declared with a
data type - or not declared at all - are implicitly declared of type `Ushort`
if the first letter of their names matches a certain letter or lies within an
inclusive range of letters.

Examples:

This will make `uNumber` a `Ushort` number since its first letter starts with
`u`.

#lang "fblite"
DefUShort u
Dim uNumber
