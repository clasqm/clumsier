BEEP
===================

Produces a beep sound.

Syntax:
declare sub Beep ( )

`
Usage:`
Beep

Description:
`Beep` tells the system to sound a beep noise. Note that this might not work
on some platforms. Since this command is not reliable and there is no way to
specify the frequency and duration, you might want to avoid it in favor of
other / better solutions, for example:

Examples:
Beep

Differences from QB:
In QB, this was a single tone noise generated through the PC speaker. Now this might not be the case.
