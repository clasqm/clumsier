Array Index
================

An array index is the number used to access an Array of Variables created
using the `Dim` command.

Description:

The following examples illustrate the use of array elements.

If we have an array `myArray` with elements of 1 to 10, filled with random
data:

 
 
    Index        Data
    1              5
    2              2
    3              6
    4              5
    5              9
    6              1
    7              0
    8              4
    9              5
    10             7

One can access each piece of data separately by pointing to the Index of the
array element:

    Print myArray(5)

Printing the data contained in the fifth element of `myArray` results in an
output of:

    	9

To change the contents of an array, use it like any other Variable:

    myArray(3) = 0

To print the contents of `myArray(3)`, use the command:

    Print myArray(3)

Which results in an output of:

 
 
    	0

Array elements can be indexed using another Variable. In this example we set
all elements in our array to zero:

    Dim a As Integer
    For a = 1 To 10
      myArray(a) = 0
    Next a

To change a random array element to a random value:

    Dim Index As Integer
    Dim Value As Integer
    index = Int(Rnd(1) * 10) \+ 1 'This line will simply return a 
                                   'random value between 1 and 10
    Value = Int(Rnd(1) * 10) \+ 1 'This line will do the same
    myArray(index) = Value



Examples:

Declare Sub PrintArray()

Dim Numbers(1 To 10) As Integer
Dim Shared OtherNumbers(1 To 10) As Integer
Dim a As Integer

Numbers(1) = 1
Numbers(2) = 2
OtherNumbers(1) = 3
OtherNumbers(2) = 4

PrintArray ()

For a = 1 To 10
 Print Numbers(a)
Next a

Print OtherNumbers(1)
Print OtherNumbers(2)
Print OtherNumbers(3)
Print OtherNumbers(4)
Print OtherNumbers(5)
Print OtherNumbers(6)
Print OtherNumbers(7)
Print OtherNumbers(8)
Print OtherNumbers(9)
Print OtherNumbers(10)

Sub PrintArray ()
 Dim a As Integer
 For a = 1 To 10
   Print otherNumbers(a)
 Next a
End Sub
