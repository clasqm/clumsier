Compiler Option: @file
================

Read (additional) command-line options from the file

Syntax:
@file

Parameters:

`file`
Name of a text file containing command line options. It's possible to use
multiple lines in the file. The options may be separated by spaces or line
breaks, and support double-quoted strings to allow spaces in parameters (like
the real command line). This file can itself contain additional `@file`
options.

Description:
The `@file` compiler option tells the compiler to parse the specified file to
find more command line options. The options found in the file are treated as
if they were found on the command line. This can be useful to pass very long
command lines to the compiler, for example on DOS, where command lines are
limited in length.

Examples:
`options.txt`:

    -d TEST=123

`opts.bas`:

Print "TEST=" & TEST

Compile with:

`fbc @options.txt opts.bas`

Output:

    TEST=123
