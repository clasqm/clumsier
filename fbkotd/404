LIB
================

Specifies the library where a sub or function can be found as part of a
declaration

Syntax:
declare { sub | function } proc_name lib "libname" [ alias "symbol_name" ] (
arguments list ) as return_type
extern "mangling" lib "libname"
declarative statements
end extern
type T
as integer dummy
declare constructor lib "libname" [ alias "symbol_name" ] ( arguments list )
end type

Description:
In `Sub` or `Function` declarations, and also in class method declarations
(including constructors and destructors), `lib` indicates the library
containing the function. Libraries specified in this way are linked in as if
`#inclib "libname"` or `-l libname` had been used.

`lib` can also be used with Extern ... End Extern blocks to specifiy a `lib`
for all declarations inside.

Examples:

'' mydll.bas
'' compile with:
''   fbc -dll mydll.bas

Public Function GetValue() As Integer Export
  Function = &h1234
End Function

Declare Function GetValue Lib "mydll" () As Integer

Print "GetValue = &h"; Hex(GetValue())

' Expected Output :
' GetValue = &h1234
