Compiler Option: -nodeflibs
===============

Do not include the default libraries

Syntax:
-nodeflibs

Description:
The `-nodeflibs` compiler option causes default libraries not to be used when
linking. The libraries which are normally linked by default can still be used,
but only if they are explicitly specified.
