EXPORT
================

Definition specifier to indicate that a procedure in a DLL should be visible
from other programs

Syntax:

{ sub | function } proc_name ( argumentlist ) [ [ byref ] as datatype ] Export

Description:
If a function is defined with this clause in a DLL, it is added to the public
export table, so external programs can dynamically link to it using
Dylibsymbol.
(specifier to be put at the level of the first line of procedure definition,
forbidden at procedure declaration line level)

Examples:

See the examples on the Shared Libraries page.

Dialect Differences:
Not available in the -lang qb dialect unless referenced with the
alias `__Export`.

Platform Differences:

  * Dynamic link libraries are not available in DOS, as the OS doesn't
  support them.

Differences from QB:
New to FreeBASIC
