$STATIC
================

Metacommand to change the way arrays are allocated

Syntax:
'$Static

or

rem $Static

Description:
`'$Static` is a metacommand that overrides the behavior of `$Dynamic`, that
is, arrays declared with constant subscript ranges are fixed-length. This
remains in effect for the rest of the module in which `'$Static` is used, and
can be overridden with `$Dynamic`. It is equivalent to the `Option Static`
statement.

Examples:

' compile with -lang fblite or qb
#lang "fblite"
'$dynamic
Dim a(100)   '<<this array will be variable-length
'$static
Dim b(100)   '<<this array will be fixed-length

Dialect Differences:
Only available in the -lang fblite and -lang qb dialects.

Differences from QB:
  * When used inside comments it must be the first token
