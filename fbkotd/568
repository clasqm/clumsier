HIBYTE
================

Gets the second byte of the operand.

Syntax:
#define Hibyte( expr ) ((Cast(Uinteger, expr) and &h0000FF00) shr 8)

Usage:
result = Hibyte( expr )

Parameters:

`expr`
A numeric expression, converted to an `Uinteger` value.

Return Value:
Returns the value of the high byte of the low 16bit word of expr.

Description:

This macro converts the numeric expression `expr` to an `Uinteger` value, then
expands to an `Uinteger` representing the value of its second byte - that is
the most-significant (high) byte of the least-significant (low) 16bit word of
expr.

Examples:

Dim N As UInteger

'Note there are 16 bits
N = &b1010101110000001
Print "N is                                       "; N
Print "The binary representation of N is          "; Bin(N)
Print "The most significant byte (MSB) of N is    "; HiByte(N)
Print "The least significant byte (LSB) of N is   "; LoByte(N)
Print "The binary representation of the MSB is    "; Bin(HiByte(N))
Print "The binary representation of the LSB is    "; Bin(LoByte(N))
Sleep


The output would look like:

 
 
    N Is                                       43905
    The Binary representation of N Is          1010101110000001
    The most significant Byte (MSB) of N Is    171
    The least significant Byte (LSB) of N Is   129
    The Binary representation of the MSB Is    10101011
    The Binary representation of the LSB Is    10000001
