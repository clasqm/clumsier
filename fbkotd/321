DEFDBL
================

Specifies a default data type for a range of variable names

Syntax:
Defdbl start_letter[-end_letter ][, ...]

Parameters:

`start_letter`
the first letter in the range

`end_letter`
the last letter in the range

Description:
`Defdbl` specifies that variables and arrays which aren't declared with a data
type - or not declared at all - are implicitly declared of type `Double` if
the first letter of their names matches a certain letter or lies within an
inclusive range of letters.

Examples:

This will make `aNum` a `Double`-precision decimal number since it is in the
range of a-d:

'' Compile with -lang fblite or qb
#lang "fblite"
DefDbl a-d
Dim aNum 'implicit: As Double
Print Len(aNum) ' Prints 8, the number of bytes in a double.

Dialect Differences:
Only available in the -lang qb and -lang fblite dialects.


Differences from QB:
  * None
