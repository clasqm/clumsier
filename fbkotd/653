WBIN
================

Returns the binary `wstring` (Unicode) representation of a number

Syntax:
declare function Wbin ( byval number as ubyte ) as wstring
declare function Wbin ( byval number as ushort ) as wstring
declare function Wbin ( byval number as ulong ) as wstring
declare function Wbin ( byval number as ulongint ) as wstring
declare function Wbin ( byval number as const any ptr ) as wstring

declare function Wbin ( byval number as ubyte, byval digits as long ) _
    as wstring
declare function Wbin ( byval number as ushort, byval digits as long ) _
    as wstring
declare function Wbin ( byval number as ulong, byval digits as long ) _
    as wstring
declare function Wbin ( byval number as ulongint, byval digits as long ) _
    as wstring
declare function Wbin ( byval number as const any ptr, byval digits _
    as long ) as wstring

Usage:
result = Wbin( number [, digits] )

Parameters:

`number`
A whole number or expression evaluating to a whole number.

`digits`
Optional number of digits to return.

Return Value:
Returns a binary `wstring` representation of `number`, truncated or padded
with zeros (`"0"`) to fit the number of digits, if specified.

Description:

Returns a `wstring` (Unicode) representing the binary value of the integer
`number`. Binary digits range from `0` to `1`.

If you specify `digits` > `0`, the result wstring will be exactly that length.
It will be truncated or padded with zeros on the left, if necessary.

The length of the returned string will not be longer than the maximum number
of digits required for the type of `expression` (32 for a `long`, 64 for
floating point or `longint`)

Examples:

Print WBin(54321)
Print WBin(54321, 5)
Print WBin(54321, 20)

will produce the output:


 
 
    1101010000110001
    10001
    00001101010000110001

Platform Differences:

  * Unicode strings are not supported in the DOS port of FreeBASIC.


Dialect Differences:
Not available in the -lang qb dialect unless referenced with the
alias `__Wbin`.

Differences from QB:
New to FreeBASIC
