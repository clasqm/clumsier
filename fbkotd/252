Compiler Option: -r
================

Compile into `*.asm/*.c/*.ll` file(s) only, do not assemble or link

Syntax:
-r

Description:
The `-r` option specifies that any source files listed are to be compiled to
`*.asm`/`*.c`/`*.ll` files, depending on the used code generation backend, and
not compiled or linked into an executable.

When using the `-r` option, `-m` must be specified when compiling the main
module.

Use the `-R` option to preserve intermediate files without affecting
compilation/assembling/linking.
Use the `-rr` option to compile input source files to `*.asm` regardless of
the code generation backend.
