Compiler Option: -rr
================

Compile into `*.asm` file(s) only, do not assemble or link

Syntax:
-rr

Description:
The `-rr` option specifies that any source files listed are to be compiled to
`*.asm` files, and not compiled or linked into an executable. Unlike with the
`-r` option, this works regardless of the used code generation backend.

When using the `-rr` option, `-m` must be specified when compiling a main
source file.

Use the `-RR` option to preserve the generated `*.asm` files without affecting
compilation/assembling/linking.
