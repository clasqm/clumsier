Procedures Overview
================

Overview of the different FB procedure types.

Procedures are blocks of code that can be executed, or called, from anywhere
in a program, any number of times. The code that is executed is called the
procedure body. There are two types of procedures in FreeBASIC: procedures
that don't return a value and procedures that do.

Subs

Subs are procedures that don't return values. They are declared using the
`Declare` keyword, and defined using the `Sub` keyword. Declaring a procedure
introduces its name so that it can be called, and a procedure definition lists
the statements of code that will be executed when called. A sub is called
simply by using its name somewhere in the program.


' introduces the sub 'MyProcedure'
Declare Sub MyProcedure

' calls the procedure 'MyProcedure'
MyProcedure

' defines the procedure body for 'MyProcedure'
Sub MyProcedure
    Print "the body of MyProcedure"
End Sub

will produce the output:


 
 
    the body of MyProcedure


Notice that only the declaration is needed to call the procedure. The
procedure can be defined later in code, or even in a different source file
altogether.

Functions

Functions are procedures that return a value back to the point in code in
which they are called. You can think of a function call as evaluating to some
expression, just like a variable or object. They are declared using the
`Declare` keyword, and defined using the `Function` keyword. The type of value
that functions return is specified at the end of the declaration.


' introduces and defines a procedure that returns an integer value
Function MyProcedure As Integer
    Return 10
End Function

' calls the procedure, and stores its return value in a variable
Dim i As Integer = MyProcedure
Print i

will produce the output:


 
 
    10

Since a definition is a declaration, a procedure can be called after it has
been defined, as well.

It is a common convention when calling a procedure to place parenthesis `'()'`
after the procedure name, to signify a procedure call. FreeBASIC does not
require this, however.
