DEFUBYTE
================

Specifies a default data type for a range of variable names

Syntax:
Defubyte start_letter[-end_letter ][, ...]

Parameters:
`start_letter`
the first letter in the range

`end_letter`
the last letter in the range

Description:

`Defubyte` specifies that variables and arrays which aren't declared with a
data type - or not declared at all - are implicitly declared of type `Ubyte`
if the first letter of their names matches a certain letter or lies within an
inclusive range of letters.

Examples:
This will make `uNumber` a `Ubyte` number since it's first letter starts with
u.

'' Compile with -lang fblite
#lang "fblite"
DefUByte u
Dim uNumber

Dialect Differences:
Available in the -lang fblite dialect.
Not available in the -lang qb dialect unless referenced with the
