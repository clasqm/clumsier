Compiler Option: -fpmode
================

Selects faster, less accurate or slower, more precise floating-point math.

Syntax:
-fpmode < mode >

Parameters:
`mode`

The floating point mode: `FAST` | `PRECISE`.

Description:

The `-fpmode` compiler option specifies whether speed or precision is more
important for floating point math. If this option is not specified, the
default is `-fpmode PRECISE`.

`-fpmode FAST` will generate faster, less accurate instructions for certain
floating point operations.

`-fpmode PRECISE` will generate standard floating point instructions that
operate at the default speed and accuracy of the selected floating point unit.

Currently, the only floating point operations that behave differently when
using `-fpmode FAST` are: `sin()`, `cos()`, reciprocal, and reciprocal square
root, all of which must operate on `Single` precision values.

Using `-fpmode PRECISE` is dependent on the `-fpu SSE` command line option.
Using `-fpmode PRECISE` without using `-fpu SSE` will generate an error.
