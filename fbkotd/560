EXTENDS WSTRING
================

Specifies a type which inherits a Wstring behavior

Syntax:
Type|Union typename Extends Wstring [, base_typename]

...

End Type|Union

Description:
`Extends Wstring` declares `typename` to inherit properties and behaviors of a
`Wstring`. Purpose is to allow users to create custom string types (with i.e.
dynamic memory management) that can integrate well in to existing fbc compiler
built ins (good interoperability with fbc's `Wstring` type).

This declaration of such a UDT with a suitable `Cast` operator will instruct
compiler to convert the UDT to a `Wstring` (in addition, other suitable
operators as `Let`, `[] (Pointer index)`, `Len`, ..., can be also declared).

`Wstring` behaviour can be inherited directly, or indirectly and singly from a
base-type.
`Wstring` behaviour can be inherited by a UDT also extending `base_typename`
(a kind of pseudo multiple-inheritance).

Note: By declaring a type (directly or indirectly) as `Extends Wstring` (in
addition to defining a suitable `Cast` operator only), this promotes it fully
compatible even with `Strptr`/`Sadd`, `Lset`/`Rset`, and `Select Case`, but
currently not yet with the built in functions
`Val`/`Valint`/`Vallng`/`Valuint`/`Valunlg` and `Left`/`Right`.

Examples:

See `Extends Zstring` for similar examples.

Dialect Differences:
Not available in the -lang qb dialect unless referenced with the
alias `__Extends __Wstring`, but unusable because no member procedure is 
allowed in this dialect.

Differences from QB:
New to FreeBASIC
